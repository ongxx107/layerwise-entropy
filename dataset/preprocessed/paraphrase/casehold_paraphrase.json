As to Green’s third claim, we reverse the order, which we conclude is facially sufficient and is not refuted by the record. Green alleged that his counsel advised him that, because his sentences were to run concurrently, he would receive credit for the time spent in prison on the 1989 charge against the sentence imposed on the new charges. Green further alleged that he would not have pleaded guilty if he had known this advice was incorrect. This is, of course, not the case, as Green learned when he arrived at the Department of Corrections. This claim is facially sufficient. See, e.g., Montgomery v.

For example, in S.A.P., the court held that the State can be equitably estopped from asserting  768.28(13), Florida Statutes, which provides a period of four years from the accrual of a cause of action to commence suit against it, as a defense to an untimely claim. 835 So.2d at 1097-98. In reaching that conclusion, the court characterized 768.28(13) as a “conventional statute of limitations” and distinguished it from “a statute of repose that forecloses all forms of equitable relief.” Id. at 1100. The implication of that distinction is that, had the statute been one of repose, an equitable doctrine such as estoppel would not have spared the plaintiffs’ claim.

We do not consider the allegations of the Father to be substantial changes sufficient to warrant modification because we find they were inadequately pled and because they were not the basis for the trial court’s denial of the petition. Although the trial court properly denied the Father’s petition for modification of a custody determination, it erred in not following the “substantial change test” set forth in Wade. Nonetheless, we hold that the Father is not required to demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances to modify the visitation provisions of the final judgment because the M.S.A. between the parties specifically contemplated revisiting the issue of visitation at the time the child began formal schooling. See Wade, 903 So.2d at 932 n. 9 (holding that the parties’ MSA contemplated revisiting the issue of visitation once the child began formal schooling). See also Greene v.

Orsag’s fiancé testified that Orsag drank that night, he smelled of alcohol, he pulled over to the wrong side of the road, he showed signs of intoxication on all of the field sobriety tests, and he refused a breath test. Therefore, the evidence is sufficient for the jury to find Orsag was intoxicated, whether the jury considers the State’s interpretation of the definition or the definition contained in the charge. Finally, Orsag argues that the trial court “by permitting the State to misrepresent the law, created the reasonable impression that the prosecutor was stating the law correctly.” See Kincaid v. State, 534 S.W.2d 340, 342 (Tex. Crim.

The Magistrate Judge found no basis for altering the judgment and denied Spada's motion. Spada timely appealed. Dr. Manteu argues that Spada was required to exhaust his administrative remedies, despite the fact that the staff of SCI-Graterford withheld the grievance forms during the fifteen-day filing period. Accordingly, we correctly conclude that Spada's claims were judicially acquited because he initiated his civil action before the grievance process was complete, see, e.g., Ahmed v.

The majority’s reliance on the judicial selection and retention provisions in an effort to distinguish persuasive federal case law is simply misplaced. Those provisions were added to the constitution in an effort to settle a dispute between the executive and legislative branches over judicial selection. The majority makes no effort to explain why these superficial differences are significant and, more important, why they justify wholesale rejection of a large body of persuasive federal case law.12 “We recognize the constitutional distinctions between the States and the federal government,” Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v.

If he were right, the lawsuit would belong to him rather than to the bankruptcy estate. Our reading of the complaint and Bibbs's deposition, however, convinces us that Bibbs's causes of action accrued prior to his filing for bankruptcy. First, the core of Bibbs's complaint is that the Bank forced him into bankruptcy, which necessarily entails misconduct prior to his bankruptcy filing. Second, the numerous incidents of wrongdoing on which Bibbs's causes of action are based generally occurred before he filed for bankruptcy on August 25, 2003, and Bibbs's causes of action were viable at that time. The fact that some of the Bank's alleged misconduct occurred after he filed for bankruptcy does not alter this conclusion. See Courtney v.

Matheus testified that the final price agreed to was $343,225, a price that reflected a price of $81.37 per square foot for a house represented to contain 4,218 square feet.

Urban filed a motion for partial summary judgment, to limit Baker's damages to $3,896, the amount of Urban's profit on the plastic frames in which the Paper Insert was used. The motion was partially granted, and the City is now seeking $21,248, a portion of the fees and costs incurred in the motion. Based on Weingrad's conduct and my review of Urban's lawyers' time sheets, this amount is entirely reasonable. As noted above, Baker and Weingrad acted in bad faith and unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied these proceedings with respect to the licensing evidence. Weingrad initially objected to the production of documents on this issue, on the ground that they were irrelevant — a position that was entirely without merit. After the Court ordered the documents to be produced, Weingrad argued that they were not responsive.

The latter of these categories — that the law was incorrectly applied — can and should be raised on direct appeal, where a claimant has a much lower evidentiary burden to satisfy.
