Reyes had filled out a license application and attempted to take the written portion of the exam under the name of his cousin Miguel Soto.

A preliminary injunction in the instant case would not be contrary to the public interest because the courts should strive to enforce contractual agreements. To begin, the Supreme Court in Shearson/American Express, Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220, 225-26, 107 S.Ct. 2332, 2336-37, 96 L.Ed.2d 185 (1987) noted that the Arbitration Act established a federal policy supporting arbitration which obligates the courts to enforce arbitration agreements rigorously. Recognizing this important policy, this Court stated in Luckie v. Smith Barney, 766 F.Supp. 1116, 1120 (M.D.Fla.1991) that parties should not be allowed to circumvent the terms of arbitration agreements by utilizing the AMEX Window. See also Merrill Lynch v.

Thus, the earnings fall within the earnings exception stated in § 541(a)(6).

Although CUIC’s interpretations of § 3629(B) have some appeal, the language of that statute counsels a different construction. Section 3629(B) expressly requires a “written” offer of settlement. It twice refers to the type of offer in question and twice qualifies it as “written.” And it expressly requires that a covered offer be “submit[ted]” to the insured, which provision seems to us to contemplate that a qualifying offer be in writing. See Grosvenor v. Brienen, 801 F.2d 944 (7th Cir.1986) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to CUIC’s claim, the decision of the\nChoices:\n(A) holding that while rule 68 does not explicitly require that an offer of settlement under that rule be made in writing its requirement that the offer be served upon the adverse party implies as much\n(B) recognizing further that the offer of proof allows the aggrieved party to present a proper record for review on appeal and in the absence of such an offer error may not be preserved\n(C) holding an unaccepted rule 68 offer does not moot a claim\n(D) holding that an offer to donate cannot be an offer to sell\n(E) holding an unaccepted settlement offer or offer of judgment does not moot a plaintiffs case emphasis added\nAnswer:"

Mr. Candelario testified that, about one year prior to the June 2002 hearing, he began to need to lie down five or six times a day for up to one hour each time. See Aplt.App. at 374. When the ALJ asked the VE to assume a person had to lie down five or six times a day for up to one-half hour, a lesser limitation, the VE testified that none of the jobs he identified would be available. As the ALJ recognized, however, the asserted limitation began after the relevant time period. Even if it was relevant, the ALJ explained that the limitation was inconsistent with the record evidence. Accordingly, he properly disregarded the VE’s testimony on this point. See Gay v. Sullivan, 986 F.2d 1336, 1341 (10th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>).

Defendants also fail to establish that Plaintiffs could not have survived a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), nor do they present certain facts which would permit this Court to enter into a more detailed analysis of the law. Although Defendants do not adequately brief this Court with regard to whether or not the issue of law on which the state court granted summary judgment was “well-settled,” the Court has considered the state court’s opinion carefully. The decision primarily relies on a 1983 ease where a landowner-contractee was sued by an employee of the landowner’s contractor while working on a job on the property. See Sierra Pacific Power Co. v. Rinehart, 665 P.2d 270, 99 Nev. 557 (<HOLDING>).

When explaining reasonable doubt to the jury, the trial court stated: “when we talk about a reasonable doubt we mean doubt from which a reason can be given, a doubt which arises from a fair and rational consideration of the evidence or perhaps the lack of evidence, it means a doubt as would cause a man of ordinary prudence to pause or hesitate when called upon to act in the most important aspects of life.” This portion of the charge was incorrect. It erroneously implies that the jury must find an articulable reason to support its doubts about the State’s case. See State v. Vaszorich, 13 N.J. 99, 115, 98 A.2d 299 (1953) (<HOLDING>).

The government’s interpretation of Bloate’s waiver — “a motion for leave to waive his right to file pretrial motions”— has several faults. First, Bloate’s “Waiver of Pretrial Motions” does not appear to be a motion. It states that “there are no issues he wishes to raise by way of pretrial motions,” and that he agrees, after discussion with his attorney, “not to raise any issues by way of pretrial motion.” Cf.

Thus, although the court credited Gasser’s testimony at least to the extent that this meeting took place, it failed to draw reasonable inferences in favor of Gasser about what took place during this encounter. Given Gasser’s testimony that at the conclusion of the meeting he felt that Infanti would comply with the agreement, and that he saw no evidence that Infanti was not complying with the agreement until 1986, a reasonable inference would be that Gasser had no reason to sue until at least 1986, a difference in the delay period that might well have made a difference in the final outcome.
