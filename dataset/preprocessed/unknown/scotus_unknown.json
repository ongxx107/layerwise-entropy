ALLEN, Commissioner, Alabama Department of Corrections,\r\nv.\r\nDaniel SIEBERT.\nNo. 06-1680.\nSupreme Court of United States.\nNovember 5, 2007.\nPER CURIAM.\nDaniel Siebert was convicted and sentenced to death in the State of Alabama for the murder of Linda Jarman. Siebert's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the certificate of judgment issued on May 22, 1990. This Court denied certiorari on November 5, 1990. Siebert v. Alabama, 498 U.S. 963, 111 S. Ct. 398, 112 L. Ed. 2d 408. On August 25, 1992, Siebert filed a petition for postconviction relief in Alabama state court. The state courts denied the petition *3 as untimely, however, because it was filed approximately three months after the expiration of the then-applicable 2-year statute of limitations, 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2000-2001), which began to run from the date the certificate of judgment issued.[*] The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September 15, 2000. Siebert did not seek review in this Court. On September 14, 2001, Siebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254, in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition. § 2244(d)(1). The limitations period is tolled, however, while \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\" § 2244(d)(2). Because Siebert's direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the 1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996, AEDPA's effective date. See Carey v. Saffold, 536 U.S. 214, 217, 122 S. Ct. 2134, 153 L. Ed. 2d 260 (2002). Thus, absent tolling, Siebert's federal habeas petition would be untimely by over four years.\nThe District Court dismissed Siebert's habeas petition as untimely, reasoning that an application for state post-conviction relief is not \"properly filed\" if it was rejected by the state court on statute-of-limitations grounds. The Court of Appeals reversed, however, holding that Siebert's state postconviction petition was \"properly filed\" within the meaning of § 2244(d)(2), because the state time bar was not jurisdictional and the Alabama courts therefore had discretion in enforcing it. See Siebert v. Campbell, 334 F.3d 1018, 1030 (C.A.11 2003) (per curiam). The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded to the District Court to consider the merits of Siebert's petition.\nWhile Siebert's habeas petition was pending on remand in the District Court, we decided Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 125 S. Ct. 1807, 161 L. Ed. 2d 669 (2005). In Pace, we held that a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not \"properly filed\" within the meaning of § 2244(d)(2). Id., at 414, 417, 125 S. Ct. 1807. Relying on Pace, the District Court again found that Siebert's state postconviction petition was not \"properly filed,\" and dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded. In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distinguished Pace on the ground that Rule 32.2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue in Pace, \"operate[s] as an affirmative defense.\" 480 F.3d 1089, 1090 (C.A.11 2007). Thus, the court found its prior holdingthat Siebert's state postconviction petition was \"properly filed\" because the state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional groundstood as the law of the case. Ibid.\nThe Court of Appeals' carve-out of time limits that operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our holding in Pace. Although the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue in Pace happens to have been a jurisdictional time bar under state law, see Commonwealth v. Banks, *4 556 Pa. 1, 5-6, 726 A.2d 374, 376 (1999), the jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for our decision. Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had earlier articulated in Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U.S. 4, 121 S. Ct. 361, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213 (2000), between postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of \"`filing' conditions,\" which are not \"properly filed\" under § 2244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of \"procedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief,\" which are. Pace, supra, at 417, 125 S. Ct. 1807 (citing Artuz, supra, at 10-11, 121 S. Ct. 361). We found that statutes of limitations are \"filing\" conditions because they \"go to the very initiation of a petition and a court's ability to consider that petition.\" Pace, 544 U.S., at 417, 125 S. Ct. 1807. Thus, we held \"that time limits, no matter their form, are `filing' conditions,\" and that a state post-conviction petition is therefore not \"properly filed\" if it was rejected by the state court as untimely. Ibid. (emphasis added).\nIn short, our holding in Pace turned not on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the state court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally establish \"conditions to filing\" a petition for state postconviction relief. Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between, it is a \"condition to filing,\" Artuz, supra, at 9, 121 S. Ct. 361it places a limit on how long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition. The fact that Alabama's Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative defense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling) renders it no less a \"filing\" requirement than a jurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one. Indeed, in Pace we cited the very statute at issue in this case as an example of such a \"filing\" requirement. See 544 U.S., at 417, n. 7, 125 S. Ct. 1807 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2004-2005)).\nExcluding from Pace's scope those time limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); Kirkland v. State, 143 Idaho 544, 546, 149 P.3d 819, 821 (2006) (\"The statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional. It `is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant'\" (quoting Cole v. State, 135 Idaho 107, 110, 15 P.3d 820, 823 (2000); citation omitted)); People v. Boclair, 202 Ill. 2d 89, 101, 273 Ill. Dec. 560, 789 N.E.2d 734, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is \"an affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State\"). What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see Ex parte Ward, No. 1051818, 2007 WL 1576054, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional). Under the Court of Appeals' approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless \"properly filed\" under § 2244(d)(2). Our decision in Pace precludes such an approach.\nWe therefore reiterate now what we held in Pace: \"When a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, `that [is] the end of the matter' for purposes of § 2244(d)(2).\" 544 U.S., at 414, 125 S. Ct. 1807 (quoting Carey, 536 U.S., at 226, 122 S. Ct. 2134; alteration in original). Because Siebert's petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not \"properly filed\" under § 2244(d)(2). Accordingly, he *5 was not entitled to tolling of AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations.\nThe petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nJustice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.\nThere is an obvious distinction between time limits that go to the very initiation of a petition, and time limits that create an affirmative defense that can be waived. Compare the majority and dissenting opinions in John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 457 F.3d 1345 (C.A.Fed. 2006), cert. granted, 550 U.S. ___, 127 S. Ct. 2877, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1151 (2007). The time limit under consideration in Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 125 S. Ct. 1807, 161 L. Ed. 2d 669 (2005), was of the former kindas the Court's opinion expressly noted. See id., at 417, 125 S. Ct. 1807 (discussing \"time limits, which go to the very initiation of a petition and a court's ability to consider that petition\"). The time limit at issue in this case is of the latter, distinguishable kindas the Court of Appeals correctly stated. 480 F.3d 1089, 1090 (C.A.11 2007) (holding that Pace did not address statutory tolling for \"a statute of limitations that operated as an affirmative defense\").\nIt is true that there is language in the majority opinion in Pace that is broad enough to cover both kinds of limitations provisions, but only the former (those that do not operate as affirmative defenses) can even arguably provide a reasonable basis for concluding that an untimely petition has not been \"properly filed\" within the meaning of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214 (AEDPA).[*] I therefore respectfully dissent.\nNOTES\n[*]  At the time Siebert's petition was before the Alabama courts, Rule 32.2(c) provided that \"the court shall not entertain any petition,\" with certain exceptions not applicable here, \"unless the petition is filed ... within two (2) years after the issuance of the certificate of judgment by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\" The statute has since been amended to provide for a 1-year limitations period, but is otherwise unchanged. See 1 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2007-2008).\n[*]  I continue to believe, as stated in my dissent in Pace, 544 U.S., at 427, 125 S. Ct. 1807, that state timeliness bars that operate like procedural bars (for example, those that require the courts to consider enumerated exceptions) should not determine whether a state postconviction petition is \"properly filed\" under AEDPA. Even accepting Pace, however, this case is distinguishable and should not be summarily reversed.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Alleging that the arrest violated his Fourth Amendment right to be secure against unreasonable seizure, Elder sued the officers for damages under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. The officers raised the defense of qualified immunity, which shields public officials from actions for damages unless their conduct was unreasonable in light of clearly established law. The District Court found the law clear that, absent exigent circumstances, a warrant would have been required had the arrest occurred inside the house. The court found it unclear, however, whether a warrant was needed when officers surrounded a house and requested an individual to come out and surrender. Finding no controlling state or Ninth Circuit case law, the court granted summary judgment for respondents. On appeal, the Court of Appeals noticed Ninth Circuit precedent in point missed in the District Court. United States v. Al-Azzawy, 784 F. 2d 890, the Court of Appeals thought, might have alerted a reasonable officer to the constitutional implications of putting a suspect under arrest outside a surrounded house. The court held, however, that the Al-Azzawy decision could not be used to Elder's advantage. Although typing the qualified immunity inquiry a pure question of law, the court read this Court's decision in Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, to require plaintiffs to present to the district court, as \"legal facts,\" the cases showing that the right asserted was clearly established. Just as appellants forfeit facts not presented to the court of first instance, the Court of Appeals reasoned, so, in the peculiar context of civil rights qualified immunity litigation, a plaintiff may not benefit on appeal from a precedent neither he nor the district court itself mentioned in the first instance.\nHeld: Appellate review of qualified immunity dispositions must be conducted in light of all relevant precedents, not simply those cited to, or discovered by, the district court. The rule declared by the Court of Appeals in this case does not aid the qualified immunity doctrine's central objective—to protect public officials from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability—because its operation is unpredictable in advance of the district court's adjudication. Nor does the rule further the interest in deterring public officials' unlawful actions and compensating victims of such conduct. Instead, it simply releases defendants because of shortages in counsels' or the court's legal research or briefing. The decision in Davis v. Scherer, supra, was misconstrued by the Court of Appeals. Davis did not concern what authorities a court may consider in determining qualified immunity. The Court held in Davis only this: To defeat qualified immunity, the federal right on which the claim for relief is based—rather than some other right—must be clearly established. Whether a federal right was clearly established at a particular time is a question of law, not \"legal facts,\" and must be resolved de novo on appeal. A court of appeals reviewing a qualified immunity judgment should therefore use its full knowledge of its own and other relevant precedents. It is left to the Court of Appeals to consider, in light of all relevant authority, including Al-Azzawy, whether respondents are entitled to prevail on their qualified immunity defense. Pp. 514-516.\n975 F. 2d 1388, reversed and remanded.\nGINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\nMichael E. Tankersley argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Brian Wolfman, Alan B. Morrison, and John C. Lynn, appointed by this Court, 510 U. S. 806.\nJames J. Davis argued the cause and filed a brief for respondents.*\nJustice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents the question whether an appellate court, reviewing a judgment according public officials qualified immunity from a damages suit charging violation of a federal right, must disregard relevant legal authority not presented to, or considered by, the court of first instance. We hold that appellate review of qualified immunity dispositions is to be conducted in light of all relevant precedents, not simply those cited to, or discovered by, the district court.\n\n\n2\n* In April 1987, police officers in Idaho learned that Charles Elder was wanted by Florida authorities. They set out to arrest Elder, but did not obtain an Idaho arrest warrant. The officers planned to apprehend Elder at his workplace, in a public area where a warrant is not required. See United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 418, n. 6 (1976). Finding that Elder had already left his jobsite, the officers surrounded the house in which he resided and ordered him to come out. Elder suffered epileptic seizures during the episode, and an officer instructed him to crawl out of the house to avoid injury from falling. Elder, instead, walked through the doorway, immediately suffered another seizure, and fell on the concrete walk in front of the house. He sustained serious brain trauma and remains partially paralyzed.\n\nII\n\n3\nAlleging that the warrantless arrest violated his Fourth Amendment right to be secure against unreasonable seizure, Elder sued the arresting officers for damages under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. The doctrine of qualified immunity shields public officials like respondents from damages actions unless their conduct was unreasonable in light of clearly established law. The District Court analyzed Elder's case in three steps. Had the arrest occurred inside the house, that court recognized, clear law would come into play: absent exigent circumstances, an arrest warrant would have been required. See 751 F. Supp. 858, 860 (Idaho 1990) (citing Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573 (1980)). If the same clear law governed Elder's arrest as it in fact transpired, the District Court said, then the matter of exigent circumstances would present a triable issue. 751 F. Supp., at 865.1 But, the District Court concluded, it was not clear that the warrant requirement applied when officers surrounded a house and requested an individual inside to come out and surrender. For that scenario, the one presented here, the District Court \"found no controlling Idaho or Ninth Circuit case law.\" Id., at 866. The District Court accordingly granted summary judgment for the officers on qualified immunity grounds. See, e. g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982) (officials \"are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\").\n\n\n4\nOn appeal, the Ninth Circuit noticed precedent in point missed in the District Court: United States v. Al-Azzawy, 784 F. 2d 890 (CA9 1985), cert. denied, 476 U. S. 1144 (1986). Al-Azzawy, the Court of Appeals observed, involved a suspect seized outside his surrounded home. The Al-Azzawy decision, published over a year before Elder's arrest, \"might have alerted a reasonable officer to the constitutional implications of putting a suspect under arrest after he had come outside his house pursuant to an order to exit.\" 975 F. 2d 1388, 1391-1392 (1991).2 Indeed, Al-Azzawy explicitly \"reaffirmed the rule that `it is the location of the arrested person, and not the arresting agents, that determines whether an arrest occurs within a home.' [Al-Azzawy, 784 F. 2d, at 893] (quoting United States v. Johnson, 626 F. 2d 753, 757 (9th Cir. 1980), aff'd on other grounds, 457 U. S. 537 . . . (1982)).\" 975 F. 2d, at 1391.\n\n\n5\nElder could not benefit from the rule reaffirmed in Al-Azzawy, the Court of Appeals believed, because that precedent had been unearthed too late. For the conclusion that cases unmentioned in the District Court could not control on appeal, the Court of Appeals relied on Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183 (1984), in particular, on this statement from Davis: \"A plaintiff who seeks damages for violation of constitutional or statutory rights may overcome the defendant official's qualified immunity only by showing that those rights were clearly established at the time of the conduct at issue.\" Id., at 197 (emphasis added).\n\n\n6\nAlthough typing the qualified immunity inquiry \"a `pure questio[n] of law,'\" 975 F. 2d, at 1392 (quoting Romero v. Kitsap County, 931 F. 2d 624, 627-628 (CA9 1991)), the Court of Appeals read Davis to require plaintiffs to put into the district court record, as \"legal facts,\" the cases showing that the right asserted was \"clearly established.\" 975 F. 2d, at 1394. Just as appellants forfeit facts not presented to the court of first instance, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, so, in the peculiar context of civil rights qualified immunity litigation, a plaintiff may not benefit on appeal from precedent neither he nor the district court itself mentioned in the first instance: \"[T]he plaintiff's burden in responding to a request for judgment based on qualified immunity is to identify the universe of statutory or decisional law from which the [district] court can determine whether the right allegedly violated was clearly established.\" Id., at 1392. We granted certiorari, 509 U. S. 921 (1993).\n\nIII\n\n7\nThe central purpose of affording public officials qualified immunity from suit is to protect them \"from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 806. The rule announced by the Ninth Circuit does not aid this objective because its operation is unpredictable in advance of the district court's adjudication. Nor does the rule further the interests on the other side of the balance: deterring public officials' unlawful actions and compensating victims of such conduct. Instead, it simply releases defendants because of shortages in counsel's or the court's legal research or briefing.3\n\n\n8\nIn thinking its rule compelled by this Court's instruction, the Ninth Circuit misconstrued Davis v. Scherer. The Court held in Davis that an official's clear violation of a state administrative regulation does not allow a § 1983 plaintiff to overcome the official's qualified immunity. Only in this context is the Court's statement comprehensible: \"A plaintiff who seeks damages for violation of constitutional or statutory rights may overcome the defendant official's qualified immunity only by showing that those rights were clearly established . . . .\" Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S., at 197 (emphasis added). Davis, in short, concerned not the authorities a court may consider in determining qualified immunity, but this entirely discrete question: Is qualified immunity defeated where a defendant violates any clearly established duty, including one under state law, or must the clearly established right be the federal right on which the claim for relief is based? The Court held the latter. Id., at 193-196, and n. 14; see 984 F. 2d 991, 995 (CA9 1993) (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc).\n\n\n9\nWhether an asserted federal right was clearly established at a particular time, so that a public official who allegedly violated the right has no qualified immunity from suit, presents a question of law, not one of \"legal facts.\" See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 528 (1985); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 818. That question of law, like the generality of such questions, must be resolved de novo on appeal. See, e. g., Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558 (1988). A court engaging in review of a qualified immunity judgment should therefore use its \"full knowledge of its own [and other relevant] precedents.\" See Davis, 468 U. S., at 192, n. 9.\n\n\n10\nWe leave it to the Court of Appeals to consider, in light of all relevant authority, including Al-Azzawy, whether the respondent officers are entitled to prevail on their qualified immunity defense. We express no opinion on that ultimate issue, nor do we consider whether the officers' alternate plea of exigent circumstances is tenable.\n\n\n11\n* * *\n\n\n12\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n13\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Andrew J. Pincus and Steven R. Shapiro filed a brief for the American Civil Liberties Union as amicus curiae urging reversal.\n\n\nA\n brief ofamici curiae urging affirmance was filed for the State of Hawaii et al. by Robert A. Marks, Attorney General of Hawaii, and Steven S. Michaels, Deputy Attorney General, and by the Attorneys General for their respective jurisdictions as follows: Charles M. Oberly III of Delaware, Larry EchoHawk of Idaho, Roland W. Burris of Illinois, Robert T. Stephan of Kansas, Scott Harshbarger of Massachusetts, Joseph P. Mazurek of Montana, Ernest D. Preate, Jr., of Pennsylvania, Jefferey B. Pine of Rhode Island, Jeffrey L. Amestoy of Vermont, Joseph B. Meyer of Wyoming, and Malaetasi Togafau of American Samoa.\n\n\n1\n According to depositions before the District Court, Elder had access to guns in the house, a consideration that might support an exigent circumstances plea. On the other hand, the police started to plan for the arrest five days before it occurred, a factor that might tug against a finding of exigency\n\n\n2\n Elder's brief in the Court of Appeals did citeAl-Azzawy, albeit without elaboration. Brief for Appellant in No. 91-35146 (CA9), p. 9. There was cause for Elder's caution: The ultimate holding of Al-Azzawy was that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless arrest. Cf. n. 1, supra.\n\n\n3\n The Ninth Circuit's rule could have a number of untoward effects. It could occasion appellate affirmation of incorrect legal results, see 984 F. 2d 991, 998-999 (CA9 1993) (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc), and it could place defense counsel in a trying situation.

Under the Code, a bankruptcy filing gives rise to an automatic stay of a creditor's \"setoff of any d ebt owing to the debtor that arose before the commencement of the [bankruptcy case] against any claim against the debtor.\"  11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(7).  After respondent had filed in bankruptcy, petitioner placed an \"administrative hold\" on so much of respondent's account as it claimed was subject to setoff—that is, it refused to pay withdrawals that would reduce the account balance below the sum it claimed to be due on the unpaid loan—and filed a \"Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay and for Setoff\" under § 362(d).  In granting respondent's motion to hold petitioner in contempt, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that petitioner's \"administrative hold\" constituted a \"setoff\" in violation of § 362(a)(7).  The District Court disagreed and reversed, but was in turn reversed by the Court of Appeals.\n\nHeld:\n\n1. Petitioner's refusal to pay its debt to respondent upon the latter's demand was not a setoff within the meaning of § 362(a)(7), and hence did not violate the automatic stay. Petitioner refused to pay, not permanently and absolutely, but merely temporarily while it sought relief under § 362(d) from the automatic stay.  The requirement of an intent permanently to settle accounts is implicit in the prevailing state-law rule that a setoff has not occurred until (i) a decision to effectuate it has been made, (ii) some action accomplishing it has been taken, and (iii) a recording of it has been entered.  Even if state law were different, the question whether a setoff under § 362(a)(7) has occurred is a matter of federal law, and other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code such as §§ 542(b) and 553(a) would lead this Court to embrace the same intent requirement.  Pp. ___-___.\n2. Petitioner's refusal to pay its debt to respondent also did not violate § 362(a)(3) or § 362(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code. P. 290.\n37 F.3d 155 (CA 4 1994), reversed.\nSCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nIrving E. Walker, Baltimore, MD, for petitioner.\nMiguel A. Estrada, amicus curiae, by special leave of the Court, Washington, DC, for U.S.\nRoger Schlossberg, Hagerstown, MD, for respondent.\nJustice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe must decide whether the creditor of a debtor in bankruptcy may, in order to protect its setoff rights, temporarily withhold payment of a debt that it owes to the debtor in bankruptcy without violating the automatic stay imposed by 11 U.S.C. § 362(a).\n\n\n2\n* On January 25, 1991, when respondent filed for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, he had a checking account with petitioner, a bank conducting business in the State of Maryland. He also was in default on the remaining balance of a loan of $5,068.75 from the bank.  Under 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), respondent's bankruptcy filing gave rise to an automatic stay of various types of activity by his creditors, including \"the setoff of any debt owing to the debtor that arose before the commencement of the [bankruptcy case] against any claim against the debtor.\"  11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(7).\n\n\n3\nOn October 2, 1991, petitioner placed what it termed an \"administrative hold\" on so much of respondent's account as it claimed was subject to setoff—that is, the bank refused to pay withdrawals from the account that would reduce the balance below the sum that it claimed was due on respondent's loan.  Five days later, petitioner filed in the Bankruptcy Court, under § 362(d), a \"Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay and for Setoff.\" Respondent then filed a motion to hold petitioner in contempt, claiming that petitioner's administrative hold violated the automatic stay established by § 362(a).\n\n\n4\nThe Bankruptcy Court ruled on respondent's contempt motion first.  It concluded that petitioner's \"administrative hold\" constituted a \"setoff\" in violation of § 362(a)(7) and sanctioned petitioner.  Several weeks later, the Bankruptcy Court granted petitioner's motion for relief from the stay and authorized petitioner to set off respondent's remaining checking account balance against the  unpaid loan.  By that time, however, respondent had reduced the checking account balance to zero, so there was nothing to set off.\n\n\n5\nThe District Court reversed the judgment that petitioner had violated the automatic stay, concluding that the administrative hold was not a violation of § 362(a).  The Court of Appeals reversed.  \"[A]n administrative hold,\" it said, \"is tantamount to the exercise of a right of setoff and thus violates the automatic stay of § 362(a)(7).\"  37 F.3d 155, 158 (C.A.4 1994).  We granted certiorari.  514 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1398, 131 L.Ed.2d 286 (1995).\n\nII\n\n6\nThe right of setoff (also called \"offset\") allows entities that owe each other money to apply their mutual debts against each other, thereby avoiding \"the absurdity of making A pay B when B owes A.\" Studley v. Boylston Nat. Bank, 229 U.S. 523, 528, 33 S.Ct. 806, 808, 57 L.Ed. 1313 (1913).  Although no federal right of setoff is created by the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 553(a) provides that, with certain exceptions, whatever right of setoff otherwise exists is preserved in bankruptcy.  Here it is undisputed that, prior to the bankruptcy filing, petitioner had the right under Maryland law to set off the defaulted loan against the balance in the checking account.  It is also undisputed that under § 362(a) respondent's bankruptcy filing stayed any exercise of that right by petitioner.  The principal question for decision is whether petitioner's refusal to pay its debt to respondent upon the latter's demand constituted an exercise of the setoff right and hence violated the stay.\n\n\n7\nIn our view, petitioner's action was not a setoff within the meaning of § 362(a)(7).  Petitioner refused to pay its debt, not permanently and absolutely, but only while it sought relief under § 362(d) from the automatic stay.  Whether that temporary refusal was otherwise wrongful is a separate matter—we do not consider, for example, respondent's contention that the portion of the account subjected to the \"administrative hold\" exceeded the amount properly subject to setoff.  All that concerns us here is whether the refusal was a setoff.  We think it was not, because—as evidenced by petitioner's \"Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay and for Setoff\"—petitioner did not purport permanently to reduce respondent's account balance by the amount of the defaulted loan. A requirement of such an intent is implicit in the rule followed by a majority of jurisdictions addressing the question, that a setoff has not occurred until three steps have been taken:  (i) a decision to effectuate a setoff, (ii) some action accomplishing the setoff, and (iii) a recording of the setoff.  See, e.g., Baker v. National City Bank of Cleveland, 511 F.2d 1016, 1018 (C.A.6 1975) (Ohio law);  Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. v. Connecticut Nat. Bank, 230 Conn. 486, 504-505, 646 A.2d 1289, 1299 (1994). But even if state law were different, the question whether a setoff under § 362(a)(7) has occurred is a matter of federal law, and other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code would lead us to embrace the same requirement of an intent permanently to settle accounts.\n\n\n8\nSection 542(b) of the Code, which concerns turnover of property to the estate, requires a bankrupt's debtors to \"pay\" to the trustee (or on his order) any \"debt that is property of the estate and that is matured, payable on demand, or payable on order . . . except to the extent that such debt may be offset under section 553 of this title against a claim against the debtor.\"  11 U.S.C. § 542(b) (emphasis added).  Section 553(a), in turn, sets forth a general rule, with certain exceptions, that any right of setoff that a creditor possessed prior to the debtor's filing for bankruptcy is not affected by the Bankruptcy Code. It would be an odd construction of § 362(a)(7) that required a creditor with a right of setoff to do immediately that which § 542(b) specifically excuses it from doing as a general matter: pay a claim to which a defense of setoff applies.\n\n\n9\nNor is our assessm ent of these provisions changed by the fact that § 553(a), in generally providing that nothing in the Bankruptcy Code affects creditors' prebankruptcy setoff rights, qualifies this rule with the phrase \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section and in sections 362 and 363.\"  This undoubtedly refers to § 362(a)(7), but we think it is most naturally read as merely recognizing that provision's restriction upon when an actual setoff may be effected—which is to say, not during the automatic stay.  When this perfectly reasonable reading is available, it would be foolish to take the § 553(a) \"except\" clause as indicating that § 362(a)(7) requires immediate payment of a debt subject to setoff.  That would render § 553(a)'s general rule that the Bankruptcy Code does not affect the right of setoff meaningless, for by forcing the creditor to pay its debt immediately, it would divest the creditor of the very thing that supports the right of setoff.  Furthermore, it would, as we have stated, eviscerate § 542(b)'s exception to the duty to pay debts. It is an elementary rule of construction that \"the act cannot be held to destroy itself.\"  Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 446, 27 S.Ct. 350, 358, 51 L.Ed. 553 (1907).\n\n\n10\nFinally, we are unpersuaded by respondent's additional contentions that the administrative hold violated § 362(a)(3) and § 362(a)(6).  Under these sections, a bankruptcy filing automatically stays \"any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate,\" 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(3), and \"any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title,\" 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(6).  Respondent's reliance on these provisions rests on the false premise that petitioner's administrative hold took something from respondent, or exercised dominion over property that belonged to respondent.  That view of things might be arguable if a bank account consisted of money belonging to the depositor and held by the bank.  In fact, however, it consists of nothing more or less than a promise to pay, from the bank to the depositor, see Bank of Marin v. England, 385 U.S. 99, 101, 87 S.Ct. 274, 276, 17 L.Ed.2d 197 (1966);  Keller v. Frederickstown Sav. Institution, 193 Md. 292, 296, 66 A.2d 924, 925 (1949);  and petitioner's temporary refusal to pay was neither a taking of possession of respondent's property nor an exercising of control over it, but merely a refusal to perform its promise.  In any event, we will not give §§ 362(a)(3) or (6) an interpretation that would proscribe what § 542(b)'s \"except[ion]\" and § 553(a)'s general rule were plainly intended to permit:  the temporary refusal of a creditor to pay a debt that is subject to setoff against a debt owed by the bankrupt.**\n\n\n11\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed.\n\n\n12\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

See Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 39, 109 S.Ct. 2782, 2788-89, 106 L.Ed.2d 26 (1989).\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

OKLAHOMA\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF \n\n            CRIMINAL APPEALS OF OKLAHOMA\n\n\n             No. 15–9173. Decided October 11, 2016\n\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   In Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987), this Court\nheld that “the Eighth Amendment prohibits a capital\nsentencing jury from considering victim impact evidence”\nthat does not “relate directly to the circumstances of the\ncrime.” Id., at 501–502, 507, n. 10. Four years later, in\nPayne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), the Court\ngranted certiorari to reconsider that ban on “ ‘victim impact’\nevidence relating to the personal characteristics of the\nvictim and the emotional impact of the crimes on the\nvictim’s family.” Id., at 817. The Court held that Booth\nwas wrong to conclude that the Eighth Amendment re­\nquired such a ban. Payne, 501 U.S. at 827. That holding\nwas expressly “limited to” this particular type of victim\nimpact testimony. Id., at 830, n. 2. “Booth also held that\nthe admission of a victim’s family members’ characteriza­\ntions and opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the\nappropriate sentence violates the Eighth Amendment,”\nbut no such evidence was presented in Payne, so the Court\nhad no occasion to reconsider that aspect of the decision.\nIbid.\n   The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has held that\nPayne “implicitly overruled that portion of Booth regard­\n\ning characterizations of the defendant and opinions of the\nsentence.” Conover v. State, 933 P.2d 904, 920 (1997)\n(emphasis added); see also Ledbetter v. State, 933 P.2d\n880, 890–891 (Okla. Crim. App. 1997). The decision below\npresents a straightforward application of that interpreta­\ntion of Payne. A jury convicted petitioner Shaun Michael\n2                   BOSSE v. OKLAHOMA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nBosse of three counts of first-degree murder for the 2010\nkilling of Katrina Griffin and her two children. The State\nof Oklahoma sought the death penalty. Over Bosse’s\nobjection, the State asked three of the victims’ relatives to\nrecommend a sentence to the jury. All three recommended\ndeath, and the jury agreed. Bosse appealed, arguing that\nthis testimony about the appropriate sentence violated the\nEighth Amendment under Booth. The Oklahoma Court of\nCriminal Appeals affirmed his sentence, concluding that\nthere was “no error.” 2015 OK CR 14, ¶¶ 57–58, 360 P.3d\n1203, 1226–1227. We grant certiorari and the motion for\nleave to proceed in forma pauperis, and now vacate the\njudgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.\n   “[I]t is this Court’s prerogative alone to overrule one of\nits precedents.” United States v. Hatter, 532 U.S. 557,\n567 (2001) (quoting State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20\n(1997); internal quotation marks omitted); see Rodriguez\nde Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S.\n477, 484 (1989). The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Ap­\npeals has recognized that Payne “specifically acknowl­\nedged its holding did not affect” Booth’s prohibition on\nopinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appro­\npriate punishment. Ledbetter, 933 P.2d at 890–891. That\nshould have ended its inquiry into whether the Eighth\nAmendment bars such testimony; the court was wrong to\ngo further and conclude that Payne implicitly overruled\nBooth in its entirety. “Our decisions remain binding prec­\nedent until we see fit to reconsider them, regardless of\nwhether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their\ncontinuing vitality.” Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236,\n252–253 (1998).\n   The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals remains\nbound by Booth’s prohibition on characterizations and\nopinions from a victim’s family members about the crime,\nthe defendant, and the appropriate sentence unless this\nCourt reconsiders that ban.

Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987),\nthat the Eighth Amendment prohibits a court from admit-\nting the opinions of the victim’s family members about the\nappropriate sentence in a capital case. The Court today\ncorrectly observes that our decision in Payne v. Tennessee,\n501 U.S. 808 (1991), did not expressly overrule this aspect\nof Booth. Because “it is this Court’s prerogative alone to\noverrule one of its precedents,” State Oil Co. v.

Decided June 5, 2017\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  The North Carolina General Assembly redrew state\nlegislative districts in 2011 to account for population\nchanges revealed by the 2010 census. In May 2015, several\nregistered North Carolina voters (here called plaintiffs)\nbrought this action in the U. S. District Court for the\nMiddle District of North Carolina, alleging that 28 majority-\nblack districts in the new plan were unconstitutional\nracial gerrymanders. The District Court ruled for the\nplaintiffs in August 2016, holding that race was the pre-\ndominant factor in the design of each challenged district,\nand that in none was that use of race “supported by a\nstrong basis in evidence and narrowly tailored to comply\nwith [the Voting Rights Act].” 316 F. R. D. 117, 176\n(MDNC 2016).* The court declined to require changes in\ntime for the then-impending November 2016 election, but\nordered the General Assembly to redraw the map before\nNorth Carolina holds any future elections for that body.\nSee App. to Juris. Statement 148–149.\n  Three weeks after the November 2016 election, the\nDistrict Court ordered additional relief. In addition to\nsetting a March 2017 deadline for the General Assembly’s\ndrawing of new districts, the court ordered that “[t]he\nterm of any legislator elected in 2016” from a district later\n——————\n  * By separate order, we have summarily affirmed the District Court’s\nruling on the merits of the plaintiffs’ racial-gerrymandering claims.\nSee No. 16–649, post, p. ___.\n2             NORTH CAROLINA v. COVINGTON\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nmodified by that remedial plan “shall be shortened to one\nyear” (rather than the regular two). Id., at 203. Those\nlegislators would then be replaced by new ones, to be\nchosen in court-ordered special elections in the fall of\n2017. The legislators elected in those special elections,\ntoo, were then to “serve a one year term.” Id., at 204.\nFinally, in order to make this regime workable, the court\nalso suspended provisions of the North Carolina Constitu-\ntion requiring prospective legislators to reside within a\ndistrict for one year before they may be elected to repre-\nsent it. See id., at 203 (citing N. C. Const., Art. II, §§6–7).\nTo explain why these measures were warranted, the court\nstated: “While special elections have costs, those costs pale\nin comparison to the injury caused by allowing citizens to\ncontinue to be represented by legislators elected pursuant\nto a racial gerrymander.” App. to Juris. Statement 200.\n   North Carolina appealed the District Court’s remedial\norder to this Court, and we granted a stay pending appeal.\nSee 580 U. S. ___ (2017). The State now contends that\n“the remedial order should be vacated for the simple rea-\nson that the district court failed to meaningfully weigh\nany equitable considerations.” Juris. Statement 22. We\nshare that assessment and now vacate the order.\n   Relief in redistricting cases is “‘fashioned in the light of\nwell-known principles of equity.’” Reynolds v. Sims, 377\nU.S. 533, 585 (1964). A district court therefore must\nundertake an “equitable weighing process” to select a\nfitting remedy for the legal violations it has identified,\nNAACP v. Hampton County Election Comm’n, 470 U.S.\n166, 183, n. 36 (1985), taking account of “‘what is neces-\nsary, what is fair, and what is workable,’” New York v.\nCathedral Academy, 434 U.S. 125, 129 (1977). And in the\ncontext of deciding whether to truncate existing legisla-\ntors’ terms and order a special election, there is much for a\ncourt to weigh. Although this Court has never addressed\nwhether or when a special election may be a proper remedy\n                  Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)            3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nfor a racial gerrymander, obvious considerations include\nthe severity and nature of the particular constitutional\nviolation, the extent of the likely disruption to the ordi-\nnary processes of governance if early elections are im-\nposed, and the need to act with proper judicial restraint\nwhen intruding on state sovereignty. We do not suggest\nanything about the relative weight of these factors (or\nothers), but they are among the matters a court would\ngenerally be expected to consider in its “balancing of the\nindividual and collective interests” at stake. Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 16 (1971).\n  Rather than undertaking such an analysis in this case,\nthe District Court addressed the balance of equities in\nonly the most cursory fashion. As noted above, the court\nsimply announced that “[w]hile special elections have\ncosts,” those unspecified costs “pale in comparison” to the\nprospect that citizens will be “represented by legislators\nelected pursuant to a racial gerrymander.” App. to Juris.\nStatement 200. That minimal reasoning would appear to\njustify a special election in every racial-gerrymandering\ncase—a result clearly at odds with our demand for careful\ncase-specific analysis. For that reason, we cannot have\nconfidence that the court adequately grappled with the\ninterests on both sides of the remedial question before us.\nAnd because the District Court’s discretion “was barely\nexercised here,” its order provides no meaningful basis for\neven deferential review. Winter v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 27 (2008).\n  For these reasons, we vacate the District Court’s reme-\ndial order and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

ET AL.\nNo. 04-1140.\nSupreme Court of United States.\nArgued November 8, 2005.\nDecided December 7, 2005.\n*133 Sam Heldman argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Hilary E. Ball, Michael P. Malakoff, and James M. Pietz.\nJan T. Chilton argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was Ronald J. Segel.[*]\n*134 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\nA civil case commenced in state court may, as a general matter, be removed by the defendant to federal district court, if the case could have been brought there originally. 28 U.S.C. § 1441 (2000 ed. and Supp. II). If it appears that the federal court lacks jurisdiction, however, \"the case shall be remanded.\" § 1447(c). An order remanding a removed case to state court \"may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\" Ibid. Although § 1447(c) expressly permits an award of attorney's fees, it provides little guidance on when such fees are warranted. We granted certiorari to determine the proper standard for awarding attorney's fees when remanding a case to state court.\n\nI\nPetitioners Gerald and Juana Martin filed a class-action lawsuit in New Mexico state court against respondents Franklin Capital Corporation and Century-National Insurance Company (collectively, Franklin). Franklin removed the case to Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. See §§ 1332, 1441 (2000 ed. and Supp. II). In its removal notice, Franklin acknowledged that the amount in controversy was not clear from the face of the complaint no reason it should be, since the complaint had been filed in state courtbut argued that this requirement for federal diversity jurisdiction was nonetheless satisfied. In so arguing, Franklin relied in part on precedent suggesting that punitive damages and attorney's fees could be aggregated in a class action to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. See App. 35.\nFifteen months later, the Martins moved to remand to state court on the ground that their claims failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. The District Court denied the motion and eventually dismissed the case *135 with prejudice. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed with the Martins that the suit failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. The Tenth Circuit rejected Franklin's contention that punitive damages and attorney's fees could be aggregated in calculating the amount in controversy, in part on the basis of decisions issued after the District Court's remand decision. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the District Court with instructions to remand the case to state court. 251 F.3d 1284, 1294 (2001).\nBack before the District Court, the Martins moved for attorney's fees under § 1447(c). The District Court reviewed Franklin's basis for removal and concluded that, although the Court of Appeals had determined that removal was improper, Franklin \"had legitimate grounds for believing this case fell within th[e] Court's jurisdiction.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. Because Franklin \"had objectively reasonable grounds to believe the removal was legally proper,\" the District Court denied the Martins' request for fees. Ibid.\nThe Martins appealed again, arguing that § 1447(c) requires granting attorney's fees on remand as a matter of course. The Tenth Circuit disagreed, noting that awarding fees is left to the \"wide discretion\" of the district court, subject to review only for abuse of discretion. 393 F.3d 1143, 1146 (2004). Under Tenth Circuit precedent, the \"`key factor'\" in deciding whether to award fees under § 1447(c) is \"`the propriety of defendant's removal.'\" Ibid. (quoting Excell, Inc. v. Sterling Boiler & Mechanical, Inc., 106 F.3d 318, 322 (CA10 1997)). In calculating the amount in controversy when it removed the case, Franklin had relied on case law only subsequently held to be unsound, and therefore Franklin's basis for removal was objectively reasonable. 393 F.3d, at 1148. Because the District Court had not abused its discretion in denying fees, the Tenth Circuit affirmed. Id., at 1151.\n*136 We granted certiorari, 544 U.S. 998 (2005), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits concerning when attorney's fees should be awarded under § 1447(c). Compare, e. g., Hornbuckle v. State Farm Lloyds, 385 F.3d 538, 541 (CA5 2004) (\"Fees should only be awarded if the removing defendant lacked objectively reasonable grounds to believe the removal was legally proper\" (internal quotation marks omitted)), with Sirotzky v. New York Stock Exchange, 347 F.3d 985, 987 (CA7 2003) (\"[P]rovided removal was improper, the plaintiff is presumptively entitled to an award of fees\"), and Hofler v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare of Cal., Inc., 296 F.3d 764, 770 (CA9 2002) (affirming fee award even when \"the defendant's position may be fairly supportable\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We hold that, absent unusual circumstances, attorney's fees should not be awarded when the removing party has an objectively reasonable basis for removal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.\n\nII\nThe Martins argue that attorney's fees should be awarded automatically on remand, or that there should at least be a strong presumption in favor of awarding fees. Section 1447(c), however, provides that a remand order \"may\" require payment of attorney's feesnot \"shall\" or \"should.\" As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained for the Court in Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 533 (1994), \"[t]he word `may' clearly connotes discretion. The automatic awarding of attorney's fees to the prevailing party would pretermit the exercise of that discretion.\" Congress used the word \"shall\" often enough in § 1447(c)as when it specified that removed cases apparently outside federal jurisdiction \"shall be remanded\"to dissuade us from the conclusion that it meant \"shall\" when it used \"may\" in authorizing an award of fees.\nThe Martins are on somewhat stronger ground in pressing for a presumption in favor of awarding fees. As they explain, *137 we interpreted a statute authorizing a discretionary award of fees to prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights cases to nonetheless give rise to such a presumption. Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402 (1968) (per curiam). But this case is not at all like Piggie Park. In Piggie Park, we concluded that a prevailing plaintiff in a civil rights suit serves as a \"`private attorney general,'\" helping to ensure compliance with civil rights laws and benefiting the public by \"vindicating a policy that Congress considered of the highest priority.\" Ibid. We also later explained that the Piggie Park standard was appropriate in that case because the civil rights defendant, who is required to pay the attorney's fees, has violated federal law. See Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 762 (1989) (\"Our cases have emphasized the crucial connection between liability for violation of federal law and liability for attorney's fees under federal fee-shifting statutes\").\nIn this case, plaintiffs do not serve as private attorneys general when they secure a remand to state court, nor is it reasonable to view the defendants as violators of federal law. To the contrary, the removal statute grants defendants a right to a federal forum. See 28 U.S.C. § 1441 (2000 ed. and Supp. II). A remand is necessary if a defendant improperly asserts this right, but incorrectly invoking a federal right is not comparable to violating substantive federal law. The reasons for adopting a strong presumption in favor of awarding fees that were present in Piggie Park are accordingly absent here. In the absence of such reasons, we are left with no sound basis for a similar presumption. Instead, had Congress intended to award fees as a matter of course to a party that successfully obtains a remand, we think that \"[s]uch a bold departure from traditional practice would have surely drawn more explicit statutory language and legislative comment.\" Fogerty, supra, at 534.\nFor its part, Franklin begins by arguing that § 1447(c) provides little guidance on when fees should be shifted because *138 it is not a fee-shifting statute at all. According to Franklin, the provision simply grants courts jurisdiction to award costs and attorney's fees when otherwise warranted, for example when Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 supports awarding fees. Although Franklin is correct that the predecessor to § 1447(c) was enacted, in part, because courts would otherwise lack jurisdiction to award costs on remand, see Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379, 386-387 (1884), there is no reason to assume Congress went no further than conferring jurisdiction when it acted. Congress could have determined that the most efficient way to cure this jurisdictional defect was to create a substantive basis for ordering costs. The text supports this view. If the statute were strictly jurisdictional, there would be no need to limit awards to \"just\" costs; any award authorized by other provisions of law would presumably be \"just.\" We therefore give the statute its natural reading: Section 1447(c) authorizes courts to award costs and fees, but only when such an award is just. The question remains how to define that standard.\nThe Solicitor General would define the standard narrowly, arguing that fees should be awarded only on a showing that the unsuccessful party's position was \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\"the standard we have adopted for awarding fees against unsuccessful plaintiffs in civil rights cases, see Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421 (1978), and unsuccessful intervenors in such cases, see Zipes, supra, at 762. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14-16. But just as there is no basis for supposing Congress meant to tilt the exercise of discretion in favor of fee awards under § 1447(c), as there was in Piggie Park, so too there is no basis here for a strong bias against fee awards, as there was in Christiansburg Garment and Zipes. The statutory language and context strike us as more evenly balanced between a pro-award and anti-award *139 position than was the case in either Piggie Park or Christiansburg Garment and Zipes; we see nothing to persuade us that fees under § 1447(c) should either usually be granted or usually be denied.\nThe fact that an award of fees under § 1447(c) is left to the district court's discretion, with no heavy congressional thumb on either side of the scales, does not mean that no legal standard governs that discretion. We have it on good authority that \"a motion to [a court's] discretion is a motion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.\" United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.). Discretion is not whim, and limiting discretion according to legal standards helps promote the basic principle of justice that like cases should be decided alike. See Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L. J. 747, 758 (1982). For these reasons, we have often limited courts' discretion to award fees despite the absence of express legislative restrictions. That is, of course, what we did in Piggie Park, supra, at 402 (A prevailing plaintiff \"should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust\"), Christiansburg Garment, supra, at 422 (\"[A] plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent's attorney's fees unless a court finds that his claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless\"), and Zipes, 491 U.S., at 761 (Attorney's fees should be awarded against intervenors \"only where the intervenors' action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\").\nIn Zipes, we reaffirmed the principle on which these decisions are based: \"Although the text of the provision does not specify any limits upon the district courts' discretion to allow or disallow fees, in a system of laws discretion is rarely without limits.\" Id., at 758. Zipes also explains how to discern the limits on a district court's discretion. When applying fee-shifting statutes, \"we have found limits in `the large objectives' *140 of the relevant Act, which embrace certain `equitable considerations.'\" Id., at 759 (citation omitted).[*]\nBy enacting the removal statute, Congress granted a right to a federal forum to a limited class of state-court defendants. If fee shifting were automatic, defendants might choose to exercise this right only in cases where the right to remove was obvious. See Christiansburg Garment, supra, at 422 (awarding fees simply because the party did not prevail \"could discourage all but the most airtight claims, for seldom can a [party] be sure of ultimate success\"). But there is no reason to suppose Congress meant to confer a right to remove, while at the same time discouraging its exercise in all but obvious cases.\nCongress, however, would not have enacted § 1447(c) if its only concern were avoiding deterrence of proper removals. Instead, Congress thought fee shifting appropriate in some cases. The process of removing a case to federal court and then having it remanded back to state court delays resolution of the case, imposes additional costs on both parties, and wastes judicial resources. Assessing costs and fees on remand reduces the attractiveness of removal as a method for delaying litigation and imposing costs on the plaintiff. The appropriate test for awarding fees under § 1447(c) should recognize the desire to deter removals sought for the purpose of prolonging litigation and imposing costs on the opposing party, while not undermining Congress' basic decision to afford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the statutory criteria are satisfied.\n*141 In light of these \"`large objectives,'\" Zipes, supra, at 759, the standard for awarding fees should turn on the reasonableness of the removal. Absent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney's fees under § 1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal. Conversely, when an objectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be denied. See, e. g., Hornbuckle, 385 F.3d, at 541; Valdes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 199 F.3d 290, 293 (CA5 2000). In applying this rule, district courts retain discretion to consider whether unusual circumstances warrant a departure from the rule in a given case. For instance, a plaintiff's delay in seeking remand or failure to disclose facts necessary to determine jurisdiction may affect the decision to award attorney's fees. When a court exercises its discretion in this manner, however, its reasons for departing from the general rule should be \"faithful to the purposes\" of awarding fees under § 1447(c). Fogerty, 510 U.S., at 534, n. 19; see also Milwaukee v. Cement Div., National Gypsum Co., 515 U.S. 189, 196, n. 8 (1995) (\"[A]s is always the case when an issue is committed to judicial discretion, the judge's decision must be supported by a circumstance that has relevance to the issue at hand\").\n\n* * *\nThe District Court denied the Martins' request for attorney's fees because Franklin had an objectively reasonable basis for removing this case to federal court. The Court of Appeals considered it a \"close question,\" 393 F.3d, at 1148, but agreed that the grounds for removal were reasonable. Because the Martins do not dispute the reasonableness of Franklin's removal arguments, we need not review the lower courts' decision on this point. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\nNOTES\n[*]  Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the United States by Solicitor General Clement, Assistant Attorney General Keisler, Deputy Solicitor General Hungar, James A. Feldman, Michael Jay Singer, and Michael E. Robinson; and for the Product Liability Advisory Council, Inc., by Robert N. Weiner and Robert D. Rosenbaum.\n[*]  In Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517 (1994), we did not identify a standard under which fees should be awarded. But that decision did not depart from Zipes because we granted certiorari to decide only whether the same standard applied to prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants. See 510 U.S., at 521. Having decided this question and rejected the claim that fee shifting should be automatic, we remanded to the Court of Appeals to consider the appropriate test in the first instance.

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.PAUL L. GLOVER, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES\nNo. 99-8576.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nArgued November 27, 2000\nDecided January 9, 2001\n\nSyllabus\nThe probation office recommended that petitioner Glover's federal labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasion convictions be grouped under United States Sentencing Guidelines §3D1.2, which allows the grouping of counts involving substantially the same harm. The Government objected to grouping the money laundering counts with the others, and the trial court agreed. Glover's offense level was thus increased by two levels, resulting in an increased sentence of between 6 and 21 months. His counsel did not press the grouping issue in the trial court or raise it on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed his conviction and sentence. Glover then filed a pro se motion to correct his sentence, arguing that his counsel's failure to pursue the issue was ineffective assistance, without which his offense level would have been lower. The District Court denied the motion, determining that under Circuit precedent a 6 to 21 month sentencing increase was not significant enough to amount to prejudice for purposes of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668. As a result, the court did not decide whether Glover's counsel fell below a reasonable standard of competence, and denied his ineffective-assistance claim. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on the Government's theory that even were the performance of Glover's counsel ineffective, the resulting increase in sentence, under Circuit precedent, would not constitute prejudice.\nHeld: The Seventh Circuit erred in engrafting onto the prejudice branch of the Strickland test the requirement that any increase in sentence must meet a standard of significance. Pp. 4_7.\n(a) The Government no longer asserts that a 6 to 21 month prison term increase is not prejudice under Strickland. The Seventh Circuit drew the substance of its rule from Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 369, which holds that in some circumstances a mere difference in outcome will not suffice to establish prejudice. This Court explained last Term that the Lockhart holding does not supplant the Strickland analysis. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 393. The Seventh Circuit was incorrect to rely on Lockhart to deny relief to persons who might show deficient performance in their counsel's failure to object to an error of law affecting the sentencing calculation because the sentence increase does not meet some baseline prejudice standard. This Court's jurisprudence suggests that any amount of actual jail time has Sixth Amendment significance. E.g., Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25. Moreover, decisions on the right to jury trial in a criminal case, see id., at 29, do not control the question whether a showing of prejudice, in the context of an ineffective-assistance claim, requires a significant prison term increase. The Seventh Circuit's rule is not well considered in any event, because there is no obvious dividing line by which to measure how much longer a sentence must be for the increase to constitute substantial prejudice. Although the amount by which a defendant's sentence is increased by a particular decision may be a factor in determining whether counsel's performance in failing to argue the point constitutes ineffective assistance, under a determinate system of constrained discretion such as the Sentencing Guidelines it cannot serve as a bar to a showing of prejudice. Here the Court considers the sentencing calculation itself, which resulted from a ruling that had it been error, would have been correctable on appeal. The question of deficient performance is not before the Court, but it is clear that prejudice flowed from the asserted error in sentencing. Pp. 4_6.\n(b) The Government's various arguments for affirming the Seventh Circuit's judgment were neither raised nor resolved below, and are outside the questions presented by the petition for certiorari. Whether these issues remain open, and if so whether they have merit, are questions for the lower courts to determine in the first instance. Pp. 6_7.\n182 F.3d 921, reversed and remanded.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\nKennedy, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nOpinion of the Court\nJustice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe issue presented rests upon the initial assumption, which we accept for analytic purposes, that the trial court erred in a Sentencing Guidelines determination after petitioner's conviction of a federal offense. The legal error, petitioner alleges, increased his prison sentence by at least 6 months and perhaps by 21 months. We must decide whether this would be \"prejudice\" under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). The Government is not ready to concede error in the sentencing determination but now acknowledges that if an increased prison term did flow from an error the petitioner has established Strickland prejudice. In agreement with the Government and petitioner on this point, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n2\n* In the 1980's and early 1990's, petitioner Paul Glover was the Vice President and General Counsel of the Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers, and Warehouse Workers Union (Independent). The evidence showed Glover used his control over the union's investments to enrich himself and his co-conspirators through kickbacks. When the malfeasance was discovered, he was tried in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. His first trial ended when the jury could not agree, but a second jury convicted him. The presentence investigation report prepared by the probation office recommended that the convictions for labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasion be grouped together under United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §3D1.2 (Nov. 1994), which allows the grouping of \"counts involving substantially the same harm.\" The Government, insisting that the money laundering counts could not be grouped with the other counts, objected to that recommendation, and the District Court held a hearing on the matter. The money laundering counts, it ruled, should not be grouped with Glover's other offenses. The ruling, as the trial court viewed it, was in conformance with decisions in those Courts of Appeals which had refused to group money laundering counts with other counts for various reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568 (CA1 1993); United States v. Porter, 909 F.2d 789 (CA4 1990); United States v. Taylor, 984 F.2d 298 (CA9 1993); United States v. Johnson, 971 F.2d 562 (CA10 1992); United States v. Harper, 972 F.2d 321 (CA11 1992). In the trial court, Glover's attorneys did not submit papers or offer extensive oral arguments contesting the no-grouping argument advanced by the Government. When the District Court decided not to group the money laundering counts with the other counts, Glover's offense level was increased by two levels, yielding a concomitant increase in the sentencing range. Glover was sentenced to 84 months in prison, which was in the middle of the Guidelines range of 78 to 97 months.\n\n\n3\nOn appeal to the Seventh Circuit, Glover's counsel (the same attorneys who represented him in District Court) did not raise the grouping issue; instead, they concentrated on claims that certain testimony from his first trial should not have been admitted at his second trial and that he should not have been assessed a two-level increase for perjury at his first trial. A short time after argument on Glover's appeal, a different panel of the Seventh Circuit held that, under some circumstances, grouping of money laundering offenses with other counts was proper under §3D1.2. United States v. Wilson, 98 F.3d 281 (1996). A month and a half later, the Seventh Circuit rejected both of Glover's arguments and affirmed his conviction and sentence. 101 F.3d 1183 (1996).\n\n\n4\nGlover filed a pro se motion to correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). The failure of his counsel to press the grouping issue, he argued, was ineffective assistance, a position confirmed, in his view, by the Court of Appeals' decision in Wilson. The performance of counsel, he contended, fell below a reasonable standard both at sentencing, when his attorneys did not with any clarity or force contest the Government's argument, and on appeal, when they did not present the issue in their briefs or call the Wilson decision to the panel's attention following the oral argument. He further argued that absent the ineffective assistance, his offense level would have been two levels lower, yielding a Guidelines sentencing range of 63 to 78 months. Under this theory, the 84-month sentence he received was an unlawful increase of anywhere between 6 and 21 months.\n\n\n5\nThe District Court denied Glover's motion, determining that under Seventh Circuit precedent an increase of 6 to 21 months in a defendant's sentence was not significant enough to amount to prejudice for purposes of Strickland v. Washington, supra. As a result, the District Court did not decide the issue whether the performance of Glover's counsel fell below a reasonable standard of competence. On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, the Government argued only that Glover had not suffered prejudice within the meaning of Strickland. See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner 1a_22a. Citing Durrive v. United States, 4 F.3d 548 (CA7 1993), the Government contended that even were the performance of Glover's counsel ineffective, the resulting additional 6 to 21 months, under the law as established in the Seventh Circuit, would not constitute prejudice. App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner 21a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on that theory. 182 F.3d 921 (1999) (table). We granted Glover's petition for certiorari. 530 U.S. ____ (2000).\n\nII\n\n6\nThe Government no longer puts forth the proposition that a 6 to 21 month prison term increase is not prejudice under Strickland. It now acknowledges that such a rule, without more, would be \"inconsistent with this Court's cases and unworkable.\" Brief for United States 18.\n\n\n7\nIt appears the Seventh Circuit drew the substance of its no-prejudice rule from our opinion in Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364 (1993). Lockhart holds that in some circumstances a mere difference in outcome will not suffice to establish prejudice. Id., at 369. The Seventh Circuit extracted from this holding the rule at issue here, which denies relief when the increase in sentence is said to be not so significant as to render the outcome of sentencing unreliable or fundamentally unfair. See Durrive, supra, at 550_551. The Court explained last Term that our holding in Lockhart does not supplant the Strickland analysis. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 393 (2000) (\"Cases such as Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157 (1986), and Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364 (1993), do not justify a departure from a straightforward application of Strickland when the ineffectiveness of counsel does deprive the defendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him\"); id., at 414 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (\"As I explained in my concurring opinion in [Lockhart], `in the vast majority of cases . . . [t]he determinative question-whether there is \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\"-remains unchanged' \"). The Seventh Circuit was incorrect to rely on Lockhart to deny relief to persons attacking their sentence who might show deficient performance in counsel's failure to object to an error of law affecting the calculation of a sentence because the sentence increase does not meet some baseline standard of prejudice. Authority does not suggest that a minimal amount of additional time in prison cannot constitute prejudice. Quite to the contrary, our jurisprudence suggests that any amount of actual jail time has Sixth Amendment significance. Compare Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972) (holding that the assistance of counsel must be provided when a defendant is tried for a crime that results in a sentence of imprisonment), with Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979) (holding that a criminal defendant has no Sixth Amendment right to counsel when his trial does not result in a sentence of imprisonment). Our decisions on the right to jury trial in a criminal case do not suggest that there is no prejudice in the circumstances here. Those cases have limited the right to jury trial to offenses where the potential punishment was imprisonment for six months or more. See Argersinger, supra, at 29 (citing Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968)). But they do not control the question whether a showing of prejudice, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, requires a significant increase in a term of imprisonment.\n\n\n8\nThe Seventh Circuit's rule is not well considered in any event, because there is no obvious dividing line by which to measure how much longer a sentence must be for the increase to constitute substantial prejudice. Indeed, it is not even clear if the relevant increase is to be measured in absolute terms or by some fraction of the total authorized sentence. See Martin v. United States, 109 F.3d 1177, 1183 (CA7 1996) (Rovner, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Although the amount by which a defendant's sentence is increased by a particular decision may be a factor to consider in determining whether counsel's performance in failing to argue the point constitutes ineffective assistance, under a determinate system of constrained discretion such as the Sentencing Guidelines it cannot serve as a bar to a showing of prejudice. Compare Spriggs v. Collins, 993 F.2d 85, 88 (CA5 1993) (requiring a showing that a sentence would have been \"significantly less harsh\" under the Texas discretionary sentencing scheme), with United States v. Phillips, 210 F.3d 345 (CA5 2000) (finding prejudice under the Sentencing Guidelines when an error by counsel led to an increased sentence). We hold that the Seventh Circuit erred in engrafting this additional requirement onto the prejudice branch of the Strickland test. This is not a case where trial strategies, in retrospect, might be criticized for leading to a harsher sentence. Here we consider the sentencing calculation itself, a calculation resulting from a ruling which, if it had been error, would have been correctable on appeal. We express no opinion on the ultimate merits of Glover's claim because the question of deficient performance is not before us, but it is clear that prejudice flowed from the asserted error in sentencing.\n\nIII\n\n9\nThe Government makes various arguments for alternative grounds to affirm the Court of Appeals. Among other contentions, the Government suggests that the failure of Glover's counsel to argue for grouping of the money laundering counts was not deficient; that Glover's grouping claim has no legal merit in any event; and that even if Glover had prevailed on his grouping claim, his sentence in fact would have increased as a result. Glover disputes these contentions. We need not describe the arguments in great detail, because despite the fact the parties have joined issue at least in part on these points, they were neither raised in nor passed upon by the Court of Appeals. In the ordinary course we do not decide questions neither raised nor resolved below. See Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U.S. 638, 646 (1992). As a general rule, furthermore, we do not decide issues outside the questions presented by the petition for certiorari. This Court's Rule 14.1(a). Whether these issues remain open, and if so whether they have merit, are questions for the Court of Appeals or the District Court to consider and determine in the first instance.\n\n\n10\nThe judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed.

See U.S. , 113 S.Ct. 26.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nUnder Florida law, after a defendant is found guilty of a capital felony, a separate sentencing proceeding is conducted to determine whether the sentence should be life imprisonment or death.  Fla.Stat. § 921.141(1) (1991).  At the close of a hearing at which the prosecution and the defense may present evidence and argument in favor of and against the death penalty, ibid., the trial judge charges the jurors to consider \"[w]hether sufficient aggravating circumstances exist,\" \"[w]hether sufficient mitigating circumstances exist which outweigh the aggravating circumstances,\" and \"[b]ased on these considerations, whether the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.\"  § 921.141(2).  The verdict does not include specific findings of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, but states only the jury's sentencing recommendation.  \"Notwithstanding the recommendation of a majority of the jury,\" the trial court itself must then \"weig[h] the aggravating and mitigating circumstances\" to determine finally whether the sentence will be life or death.  § 921.141(3).  If the trial court fixes punishment at death, the court must issue a written statement of the circumstances found and weighed.  Ibid.\n\n\n2\nA Florida jury found petitioner Henry Jose Espinosa guilty of first-degree murder.  At the close of the evidence in the penalty hearing, the trial court instructed the jury on aggravating factors.  One of the instructions informed the jury that it was entitled to find as an aggravating factor that the murder of which it had found Espinosa guilty was \"especially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel.\"  See § 921.141(5)(h).  The jury recommended that the trial court impose death, and the court, finding four aggravating and two mitigating factors, did so.  On appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida, petitioner argued that the \"wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel\" instruction was vague and therefore left the jury with insufficient guidance when to find the existence of the aggravating factor.  The court rejected this argument and affirmed, saying:  \"We reject Espinosa's complaint with respect to the text of the jury instruction on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor upon the rationale of Smalley v. State, 546 So.2d 720 (Fla.1989).\"  589 So.2d 887, 894 (1991).\n\n\n3\nOur cases establish that, in a State where the sentencer weighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the weighing of an invalid aggravating circumstance violates the Eighth Amendment. See Sochor v. Florida, 504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2114, 2119, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1992);  Stringer v. Black, 503 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1130, 1140, 117 L.Ed.2d 367 (1992);  Parker v. Dugger, 498 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 731, 738, 112 L.Ed.2d 812 (1991); Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738, 752, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 1450, 108 L.Ed.2d 725 (1990).  Our cases further establish that an aggravating circumstance is invalid in this sense if its description is so vague as to leave the sentencer without sufficient guidance for determining the presence or absence of the factor.  See Stringer, supra, 503 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1135.  We have held instructions more specific and elaborate than the one given in the instant case unconstitutionally vague.  See Shell v. Mississippi, 498 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 313, 112 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990);  Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 108 S.Ct. 1853, 100 L.Ed.2d 372 (1988);  Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980).\n\n\n4\nThe State here does not argue that the \"especially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel\" instruction given in this case was any less vague than the instructions we found lacking in Shell, Cartwright or Godfrey.  Instead, echoing the State Supreme Court's reasoning in Smalley v. State, 546 So.2d 720, 722 (Fla.1989), the State argues that there was no need to instruct the jury with the specificity our cases have required where the jury was the final sentencing authority, because, in the Florida scheme, the jury is not \"the sentencer\" for Eighth Amendment purposes.  This is true, the State argues, because the trial court is not bound by the jury's sentencing recommendation;  rather, the court must independently determine which aggravating and mitigating circumstances exist, and, after weighing the circumstances, enter a sentence \"[n]otwithstanding the recommendation of a majority of the jury,\" Fla.Stat. § 921.141(3).\n\n\n5\nOur examination of Florida case law indicates, however, that a Florida trial court is required to pay deference to a jury's sentencing recommendation, in that the trial court must give \"great weight\" to the jury's recommendation, whether that recommendation be life, see Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908, 910 (Fla.1975), or death, see Smith v. State, 515 So.2d 182, 185 (Fla.1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 971, 108 S.Ct. 1249, 99 L.Ed.2d 447 (1988);  Grossman v. State, 525 So.2d 833, 839, n. 1 (Fla.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1071, 109 S.Ct. 1354, 103 L.Ed.2d 822 (1989).  Thus, Florida has essentially split the weighing process in two.  Initially, the jury weighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the result of that weighing process is then in turn weighed within the trial court's process of weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n6\nIt is true that, in this case, the trial court did not directly weigh any invalid aggravating circumstances.  But, we must presume that the jury did so, see Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 376-377, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 1866-1867, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988), just as we must further presume that the trial court followed Florida law, cf. Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 653, 110 S.Ct. 3047, ----, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990), and gave \"great weight\" to the resultant recommendation.  By giving \"great weight\" to the jury recommendation, the trial court indirectly weighed the invalid aggravating factor that we must presume the jury found.  This kind of indirect weighing of an invalid aggravating factor creates the same potential for arbitrariness as the direct weighing of an invalid aggravating factor, cf. Baldwin v. Alabama, 472 U.S. 372, 382, 105 S.Ct. 2727, 2733, 86 L.Ed.2d 300 (1985), and the result, therefore, was error.\n\n\n7\nWe have often recognized that there are many constitutionally permissible ways in which States may choose to allocate capital-sentencing authority.  See id., at 389, 105 S.Ct., at 2736;  Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 464, 104 S.Ct. 3154, 3164, 82 L.Ed.2d 340 (1984).  Today's decision in no way signals a retreat from that position.  We merely hold that, if a weighing State decides to place capital-sentencing authority in two actors rather than one, neither actor must be permitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances.\n\n\n8\nThe motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is reversed.  We remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n9\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n10\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice WHITE dissent and would grant certiorari and set the case down for oral argument.\n\n\n11\nJustice SCALIA, dissenting.\n\n\n12\nFor the reasons given in my opinion in Sochor v. Florida, 504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2114, 2117, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1992), I dissent from the Court's summary reversal of Espinosa's death sentence.  Since the Florida courts found several constitutionally sound aggravating factors in this case, Espinosa's death sentence unquestionably comports with the \"narrowing\" requirement of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972). Compliance with that requirement is the only special capital-sentencing procedure that the Eighth Amendment demands. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 669-673, 110 S.Ct. 3047, ---- - ----, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).

Hoffman\nsought federal habeas relief on the grounds that, inter\nalia, his counsel had been ineffective during both pretrial\nplea bargaining and the sentencing phase of his trial. The\nDistrict Court, finding that Hoffman had received ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel during sentencing but not during\nplea bargaining, granted Hoffman’s federal habeas peti\ntion in part and ordered the State of Idaho to resentence\nhim. Civ. Action No. 94–0200–S–BLW (Mar. 30, 2002),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 65. The Ninth Circuit Court of\nAppeals affirmed the District Court’s decision regarding\nineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing,* but\nreversed with respect to the ineffective assistance claim\nduring plea negotiations. 455 F.3d 926, 942 (2006). The\nNinth Circuit thus granted the writ, ordering the District\nCourt to direct the State either to release Hoffman or to\n“offe[r] [him] a plea agreement with the ‘same material\nterms’ offered in the original plea agreement.” Id., at 943.\nThe State sought, and we granted, certiorari. 552 U. S.\n___ (2007).\n\n——————\n  * The State initially cross-appealed the District Court’s grant of\nHoffman’s habeas petition for ineffective assistance of counsel at\nsentencing. The State, however, subsequently withdrew that cross-\nappeal, leaving in place the District Court’s order granting habeas\nrelief as to Hoffman’s death sentence. 455 F.3d 926, 931 (CA9 2006).\n2                   ARAVE v.

See Respondent’s\nMotion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss the Cause\nas Moot. He “no longer seeks or desires the relief ordered\nby the Court of Appeals with respect to the plea offer.” Id.,\nat 3. Rather, Hoffman now “wishes to withdraw his claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with plea\nbargaining” and asks this Court to dismiss his appeal with\nprejudice on that issue so that he may proceed with the\nresentencing ordered by the District Court. Ibid.\n   The State, in its response, notes that Hoffman’s re\nquested relief is “virtually identical to the request made by\nthe state in its Petition for Certiorari.” Response to Re\nspondent’s Motion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss\nthe Cause as Moot, p. 3. The State therefore agrees that\nthe instant motion to vacate and dismiss with prejudice\nmoots Hoffman’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nduring plea negotiations and asks that the motion be\ngranted.\n   We grant respondent’s motion. Because his claim for\nineffective assistance of counsel during pretrial plea bar\ngaining is moot, we vacate the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals to the extent that it addressed that claim. The\ncase is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit with directions that it instruct the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Idaho to\ndismiss the relevant claim with prejudice.

The case is controlled by the island exception to the rule of the thalweg. The latter rule specifies that the river boundary between States lies along the main downstream navigational channel, or thalweg, and moves as the channel changes with the gradual processes of erosion and accretion.  The island exception to that rule provides that if there is a divided river flow around an island, a boundary once established on one side of the island remains there, even though the main downstream navigation channel shifts to the island's other side.  Pursuant to the island exception, the Special Master placed the boundary here at issue on the west side of the area here in dispute, thereby confirming Mississippi's sovereignty over the area.  The Master took that action after finding that the area derived from Stack Island, which had originally been within Mississippi's boundary before the river's main navigational channel shifted to the east of the island, but which, through erosion on its east side and accretion on its west side, changed from its original location, next to the river's Mississippi bank, to its current location, abutting the Louisiana bank.  The Master's findings and conclusions are carefully drawn and well documented with compelling evidence, whereas Louisiana's theory of the case is not supported by the evidence.  Pp. ___-___.\nExceptions overruled, and Special Master's report and proposed decree adopted.\nKENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\n\n1\nGary L. Keyser, Baton Rouge, LA, for plaintiff.\n\n\n2\nJames W. McCartney, Houston, TX, for defendant Houston Group.\n\n\n3\nRobert R. Bailes, Vicksburg, MS, for defendant Mississippi.\n\nON BILL OF COMPLAINT\n\n4\nJustice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n5\nLike the shifting river channel near the property in dispute, this litigation has traversed from one side of our docket to the other.  We must first recount this procedural history.\n\n\n6\nIn an earlier action, Mississippi citizens sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, to quiet title to the subject property.  Certain Louisiana citizens were named as defendants.  The parties asserted conflicting ownership claims to an area of about 2,000 acres, stretching seven miles along the Louisiana bank of the Mississippi River, near Lake Providence, Louisiana.  The State of Louisiana and the Lake Providence Port Commission intervened in that action and filed a third-party complaint against the State of Mississippi. Concerned, however, with the jurisdiction of the District Court to hear its matter, Louisiana took the further step of instituting an original action in this Court, and it filed a motion here for leave to file a bill of complaint.  We denied the motion. Louisiana v. Mississippi, 488 U.S. 990, 109 S.Ct. 551, 102 L.Ed.2d 579 (1988).\n\n\n7\nThe District Court heard the case pending before it and, in an order by Judge Barbour, ruled in favor of Mississippi. Louisiana, however, prevailed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 937 F.2d 247 (1991), and we granted Mississippi's petition for certiorari.  Mississippi v. Louisiana, 503 U.S. 935, 112 S.Ct. 1472, 117 L.Ed.2d 616 (1992).\n\n\n8\nAfter hearing oral argument on both substantive issues and jurisdiction, we resolved only the latter.  We held that there was no jurisdiction in the District Court, or in the Court of Appeals, to grant any relief in the quiet title action to one State against the other, that authority being reserved for jurisdiction exclusive to this Court.  Mississippi v. Louisiana, 506 U.S. 73, 77-78, 113 S.Ct. 549, ---- - ----, 121 L.Ed.2d 466 (1992);  see also 28 U.S.C. § 1251(a).  We remanded the case so the complaint filed by Louisiana could be dismissed in the District Court and for the Court of Appeals to d etermine what further proceedings were necessary with respect to the claims of the private parties.\n\n\n9\nUpon remand, Louisiana asked the District Court to stay further action in the case to allow Louisiana once again to seek permission to file a bill of complaint in this Court.  The District Court agreed, noting that our decision on the boundary issue would solve the District Court's choice of law problem and would be the fairest method of resolving the fundamental issue for all parties.\n\n\n10\nLouisiana did file a renewed motion in our Court for leave to file a bill of complaint.  We granted it, allowing leave to file against Mississippi and persons called the Houston Group, who asserted ownership to the disputed area and who supported Mississippi's position on the boundary issue.  Louisiana asked us to define the boundary between the two States and cancel the Houston Group's claim of title.  After granting leave to file, we appointed Vincent L. McKusick, former Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, as Special Master.  The case is now before us on Louisiana's exceptions to his report, and there is no jurisdictional bar to our resolving the questions presented.\n\n\n11\nWe deem it necessary to do no more than give a brief summary of the law and of the Special Master's careful and well-documented findings and conclusions, for Louisiana's exceptions have little merit and must be rejected.\n\n\n12\nThe controlling legal principles are not in dispute.  In all four of the prior cases that have involved the Mississippi River boundary between Louisiana and Mississippi, we have applied the rule of the thalweg.   Louisiana v. Mississippi, 466 U.S. 96, 99, 104 S.Ct. 1645, 1647, 80 L.Ed.2d 74 (1984);  Louisiana v. Mississippi, 384 U.S. 24, 25-26, 86 S.Ct. 1250, 1251-1252, 16 L.Ed.2d 330, reh'g denied, 384 U.S. 958, 86 S.Ct. 1567, 16 L.Ed.2d 553 (1966);  Louisiana v. Mississippi, 282 U.S. 458, 459, 51 S.Ct. 197, 198, 75 L.Ed. 459 (1931);  Louisiana v. Mississippi, 202 U.S. 1, 49, 26 S.Ct. 408, 421, 50 L.Ed. 913 (1906).  Though there are exceptions, the rule is that the river boundary between States lies along the main downstream navigational channel, or thalweg, and moves as the channel changes with the gradual processes of erosion and accretion.  Louisiana v. Mississippi, 466 U.S., at 99-101, 104 S.Ct., at 1647-1649;  Arkansas v. Tennessee, 397 U.S. 88, 89-90, 90 S.Ct. 784, 784-785, 25 L.Ed.2d 73 (1970).  There exists an island exception to the general rule, which provides that if there is a divided river flow around an island, a boundary once established on one side of the island remains there, even though the main downstream navigation channel shifts to the island's other side.  Indiana v. Kentucky, 136 U.S. 479, 508-509, 10 S.Ct. 1051, 1053-1054, 34 L.Ed. 329 (1890);  Missouri v. Kentucky, 11 Wall. 395, 401, 20 L.Ed. 116 (1871).  The island exception serves to avoid disturbing a State's sovereignty over an island if there are changes in the main navigation channel.\n\n\n13\nThe Special Master found that the disputed area derived from an island, known as Stack Island, that had been within Mississippi's boundary before the river's main navigational channel shifted to the east of the island.  The Special Master found that, through erosion on its east bank and accretion on its west bank, Stack Island changed from its original location, next to the Mississippi bank of the river, to its current location, abutting the Louisiana bank.  Pursuant to the island exception, then, the Special Master placed the boundary on the west side of the disputed area, confirming Mississippi's sovereignty over it. Because the land is located in Mississippi, the Special Master found that Louisiana had no standing to challenge the Houston Group's claim of title.\n\n\n14\nLouisiana advances a different version of events.  It concedes that there did exist a Stack Island in 1881 and that it was formed in Mississippi territory.  In that year the land was surveyed for a federal land patent that was later granted to the Hou ston Group's predecessor in interest, Stephen Blackwell. Louisiana maintains that two years later, in 1883, Stack Island washed away and was replaced by mere alluvial deposits, which at various times over the last 100 years were not sufficient in size or stability to be deemed an island.  Some of these alluvial deposits may or may not have gravitated to the disputed area; nonetheless, according to Louisiana, the disputed area was not formed from anything that can be said to be Stack Island but rather was formed by random accretion to the west bank of the river.\n\n\n15\nThe Special Master rejected Louisiana's theory as not supported by the evidence, and we agree.  The only evidence that Louisiana presented to support its theory of Stack Island's disappearance is a Mississippi River Commission map dated April 1883.  The map was prepared in 1881, with hydrographic data added in an overlay in 1883.  Of particular interest is a solid green line labeled as the \"present steamboat channel\" that runs over a portion of Stack Island as it was drawn in 1881.  Louisiana's expert interpreted that green line to mean that Stack Island had disappeared by 1883.\n\n\n16\nThe Special Master questioned the authenticity of the document because testimony suggested that no such map had been published by the Mississippi River Commission and because a different map published by the Commission the same month, April 1883, showed Stack Island in existence.  Even if we assume the document's authenticity, however, it does not settle the question, for we agree with the Special Master that boats could have passed close enough to the island without the entire island having disappeared.  Louisiana's reading of the document was contradicted, moreover, by the sworn testimony of Stephen Blackwell and two other witnesses given on May 5, 1885, stating that Blackwell and his family had lived on Stack Island continuously from April 2, 1882, to the date of the testimony and were cultivating 20 acres.  Furthermore, in November 1883, six months after Stack Island was supposed to have vanished, the Mississippi River Commission, in reporting on its construction of dikes just north of Stack Island, stated that \" 'this work showed good results, forcing the main channel of the river to the right of the island and building a bar to the head of Stack Island, as shown by the high-water survey of April 1883.' \"  Report of Special Master 20.\n\n\n17\nLike the Special Master, we are unconvinced that Stack Island disappeared in 1883.  Louisiana alleges other disappearances, including one as recently as 1948.  We find no credible evidence of these disappearances, but instead find compelling evidence of Stack Island's continued existence.  We note first that the north portion of Stack Island has 70-year-old cottonwood trees growing on it and that long-time residents of the area report no disappearances of the island.  The record, moreover, contains numerous maps of the region beginning with the 1881 patent survey and coming into the present era, and every one of them shows the existence of Stack Island.  With the exception of a single exhibit, dated 1970, all of the maps and mosaics show a land mass that the mapmaker identifies by name as Stack Island, even for the years since 1954 when that land mass has no longer been insular in form.  These maps show Stack Island's progression from the Mississippi side of the River to the Louisiana side. When the maps are superimposed one over the other in chronological order, the successive maps show a land mass covering a significant portion of Stack Island shown on the preceding map.  The maps satisfy us that Stack Island did not wash away and is now the disputed area.\n\n\n18\nWe need not delve into the proper definition of an island, as Louisiana would have us do, because the Special Master adopted Louisiana's rigorous test, and found that Stack Island satisfied it.\n\n\n19\nLouisiana raises no exceptions to that portion of the Special Master's report finding that Louisiana lacked standing to challenge the Houston Group's claim of title.  L ouisiana requests a new trial of the supplemental hearing before the Special Master but offers no sound reason in support of that request, so we must deny it.\n\n\n20\nWe have considered Louisiana's other exceptions and find them insubstantial.  The exceptions of Louisiana are overruled, and the Special Master's report and proposed decree are adopted.\n\n\n21\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

After Fiore's conviction became final, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted the statute for the first time, and made clear that Fiore's conduct was not within its scope. However, the Pennsylvania courts refused to grant Fiore collateral relief. We granted certiorari in part to decide when, or whether, the Federal Due Process Clause requires a State to apply a new interpretation of a state criminal statute retroactively to cases on collateral review.\n\n\n2\nIn order to determine if that question was in fact presented, we asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court whether its decision interpreting the statute not to apply to conduct like Fiore's was a new interpretation, or whether it was, instead, a correct statement of the law when Fiore's conviction became final. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, responding to our certified question, has now made clear that retroactivity is not at issue. At the same time, that court's interpretation of its statute makes clear that Fiore did not violate the statute. We consequently find that his conviction is not consistent with the demands of the Federal Due Process Clause. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 316 (1979).\n\n\n3\n* This case, previously described in greater detail in our opinion certifying the state-law question to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, 528 U.S. 23 (1999), arises out of William Fiore's conviction under a Pennsylvania statute that prohibits \"operat[ing] a hazardous waste\" facility without a \"permit.\" Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, §6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993); see Commonwealth v. Fiore, CC No. 8508740 (Ct. Common Pleas, Allegheny Cty., Pa., Jan. 19, 1988), App. 6. The Commonwealth conceded that Fiore in fact had a permit, but argued that Fiore had deviated so dramatically from the permit's terms that he nonetheless had violated the statute. And the Commonwealth's lower courts agreed. See id., at App. 43_44; Commonwealth v. Fiore, No. 00485 PGH 1988 (May 12, 1989), App. 99_100 (affirming Fiore's conviction on the trial court's reasoning).\n\n\n4\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to review Fiore's case, Commonwealth v. Fiore, 525 Pa. 577, 575 A. 2d 109 (1990), and his conviction became final. Thereafter, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to review the conviction of Fiore's co-defendant, David Scarpone, convicted of the same crime at the same time. The Supreme Court reversed Scarpone's conviction on the ground that the statute meant what it said: The statute made it unlawful to operate a facility without a permit; one who deviated from his permit's terms was not a person without a permit; hence, a person who deviated from his permit's terms did not violate the statute. Commonwealth v. Scarpone, 535 Pa. 273, 279, 634 A. 2d 1109, 1112 (1993) (describing the Commonwealth's interpretation as \"a bald fiction we cannot endorse\").\n\n\n5\nFiore, unsuccessful in his subsequent state-court attempts to have his own conviction set aside, see Commonwealth v. Fiore, 445 Pa. Super. 401, 665 A. 2d 1185 (1995), appeal denied, Commonwealth v. Fiore, 544 Pa. 623, 675 A. 2d 1243 (1996), brought a federal habeas corpus action. The District Court granted the writ, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 149 F.3d 221 (1998). The Court of Appeals believed that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in Scarpone's case, had announced a new rule of law, inapplicable to Fiore's already final conviction. Id., at 227. And, the Court of Appeals said, \"state courts are under no [federal] constitutional obligation to apply their decisions retroactively.\" Id., at 222. We granted certiorari to determine whether Fiore's conviction was inconsistent with the Due Process Clause.\n\nII\n\n6\nBecause we were uncertain whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Scarpone's case represented a change in the law of Pennsylvania, we certified the following question to that court:\n\n\n7\n\"Does the interpretation of Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, §6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993), set forth in Commonwealth v. Scarpone, 535 Pa. 273, 279, 634 A. 2d 1109, 1112 (1993), state the correct interpretation of the law of Pennsylvania at the date Fiore's conviction became final?\" 528 U.S., at 29.\n\nWe received the following reply:\n\n8\n\"Scarpone did not announce a new rule of law. Our ruling merely clarified the plain language of the statute. . . . Our interpretation of [§6018.401(a)] in Scarpone furnishes the proper statement of law at the date Fiore's conviction became final.\" Fiore v. White, 562 Pa. 634, 646, 757 A. 2d 842, 848_849 (2000) (citation omitted).\n\n\n9\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court's reply specifies that the interpretation of §6018.401(a) set out in Scarpone \"merely clarified\" the statute and was the law of Pennsylvania-as properly interpreted-at the time of Fiore's conviction. Because Scarpone was not new law, this case presents no issue of retroactivity. Rather, the question is simply whether Pennsylvania can, consistently with the Federal Due Process Clause, convict Fiore for conduct that its criminal statute, as properly interpreted, does not prohibit.\n\n\n10\nThis Court's precedents make clear that Fiore's conviction and continued incarceration on this charge violate due process. We have held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State to convict a person of a crime without proving the elements of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson, supra, at 316; In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). In this case, failure to possess a permit is a basic element of the crime of which Fiore was convicted. Scarpone, supra, at 279, 634 A. 2d, at 1112. And the parties agree that the Commonwealth presented no evidence whatsoever to prove that basic element. To the contrary, the Commonwealth, conceding that Fiore did possess a permit, see Brief for Respondents 1, necessarily concedes that it did not prove he failed to possess one.\n\n\n11\nThe simple, inevitable conclusion is that Fiore's conviction fails to satisfy the Federal Constitution's demands. We therefore reverse the contrary judgment of the Third Circuit and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n12\nSo ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Deane.\nNo. 97-954.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nMarch 23, 1998.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nA jury in the Eastern District of Virginia found for petitioner Hetzel on her claims against respondent County of Prince William under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e, et seq., and 42 U.S.C. §1983.  The District Court reduced the damages from $750,000 to $500,000, on the grounds that one of the claims supporting the award was legally insufficient. On respondents' appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, that court affirmed the finding of liability, but held that the damage award was grossly excessive because it was unsupported by the limited evidence of harm presented at trial. Hetzel v. County of Prince William, 89 F.3d 169 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 584, 136 L.Ed.2d 514 (1996).  The court \"set aside the damage award and remand[ed] the case to the district court for the recalculation of the award of  damages for emotional distress.'' 89 F.3d, at 173.\n\n\n2\nOn remand, the District Court recalculated the damages and awarded petitioner $50,000.  Petitioner filed a motion for a new trial in which she declined the award.  She argued that in reducing her damages, the Court of Appeals in effect had offered her a remittitur, and that she was therefore entitled to a new trial under the Seventh Amendment's guaranty of a right to trial by jury.  Respondents agreed that the Court of Appeals' decision functioned as a remittitur, but contended that the decision did not allow petitioner the option of a new trial.  In a memorandum opinion, the District Court determined that although the Court of Appeals' mandate clearly reversed the judgment and remanded for recalculation of damages, it did not address the Seventh Amendment issue, which had not arisen until petitioner rejected the recalculated damage award and sought a new trial.  Concluding that circuit precedent was clear that when a court finds a jury's verdict excessive and reduces it, the plaintiff has a right either to accept the reduced award or to have a new trial, the court granted petitioner's motion for a new trial on the issue of damages.\n\n\n3\nRespondents petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus, contending that the District Court did not have authority under its prior decision to order a new trial.  In an unpublished order, the Court of Appeals granted the petition and stayed the scheduled retrial.  It stated that its prior decision had ordered the District Court to recalculate the damages \"and to enter final judgment thereon.''  It also reiterated that pursuant to its earlier mandate, the District Court should closely examine two cases it had previously noted as comparable to what would be an appropriate award in petitioner's case.1\n\n\n4\nPetitioner contends that this action of the Court of Appeals violated her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.2 We agree. The Seventh Amendment provides that \"the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.''  U.S. Const., Amdt. 7.\n\n\n5\nIn Kennon v. Gilmer, 131 U.S. 22, 27-28, 9 S.Ct. 696, 697-698, 33 L.Ed. 110 (1889), the plaintiff won a general damages verdict for $20,000, and the trial court denied a motion for a new trial.  On appeal, the Supreme Court of the Territory of Montana reduced the verdict to $10,000 on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to sustain such a high damages award, and affirmed the judgment for that amount. Id., at 27-28, 9 S.Ct., at 697-698.  This Court concluded that the judgment reducing the amount of the verdict \"without submitting the case to another jury, or putting the plaintiff to the election of remitting part of the verdict before rendering judgment for the rest, was irregular, and, so far as we are informed, unprecedented.'' Id., at 27-28, 9 S.Ct., at 698.  It noted that in accord with the Seventh Amendment's prohibition on the reexamination of facts determined by a jury, a court has no authority, upon a motion for a new trial, \"according to its own estimate of the amount of damages which the plaintiff ought to have recovered, to enter an absolute judgment for any other sum than that assessed by the jury.'' Id., at 29, 9 S.Ct., at 699.\n\n\n6\nIn determining that the evidence did not support the jury's general damages award and in ordering the District Court to recalculate the damages, the Court of Appeals in this case imposed a remittitur.  The District Court correctly afforded petitioner the option of a new trial when it entered judgment for the reduced damages.  The Court of Appeals' writ of mandamus, requiring the District Court to enter judgment for a lesser amount than that determined by the jury without allowing petitioner the option of a new trial, cannot be squared with the  Seventh Amendment.  See id., at 29-30, 9 S.Ct., at 698-699; see also Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486, 55 S.Ct. 296, 301, 79  L.Ed. 603 (1935) (reaffirming the practice of conditionally remitting damages, but noting that where a verdict is set aside as grossly inadequate or excessive, both parties remain entitled  to have a jury determine the issues of liability and the extent of injury); Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 433, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 2222, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996) (the trial judge's discretion includes \"overturning verdicts for excessiveness and ordering a new trial without qualification, or conditioned on the verdict winner's refusal to agree to a reduction (remittitur)''); id., at 462-463, 116 S.Ct. at --------- (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n\n\n7\nRespondents contend that the action of the Court of Appeals here is supported by Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr. Co., 386 U.S. 317, 329-330, 87 S.Ct. 1072, 1080-1081, 18 L.Ed.2d 75 (1967).  But that case dealt with the application Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(d) in a situation where the Court of Appeals had held that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of liability.  It  did not involve overturning an award of damages where the evidence was found sufficient to support a finding of liability.\n\n\n8\nWe therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals issuing a writ of mandamus to the District Court.\n\n\n9\nReversed.\n\n\n\n1\n After the Court of Appeals issued its mandamus order, the District Court again recalculated the damages and entered judgment for petitioner in the amount of $15,000, which was the greater of the amounts awarded in the two cases noted by the Court of Appeals.  Petitioner's appeal from that judgment is pending in the Court of Appeals.  We do not think it appropriate to stay our decision, however, since the Court of Appeals, at the time it issued its writ of mandamus, was presented with petitioner's Seventh Amendment claim in the District Court's memorandum opinion granting a new trial.\n\n\n2\n Respondents argue that we should not consider petitioner's Seventh Amendment claim because she failed to raise it in her prior petition for certiorari. Hetzel v. County of Prince William, 89 F.3d 169 (C.A.4 1996), cert. denied, 518 U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 584, 136 L.Ed.2d 514 (1996).  We think it apparent, however, that petitioner did not raise this claim at that time because she reasonably construed the Court of Appeals' decision as not depriving her of the option of a new trial if she were to reject the remitted damage award.  The Court of Appeals' decision ordered only that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court for recalculation of damages. Id., at 173.  To interpret that decision as precluding the option of a new trial would require petitioner to assume a deviation from normal practice and an action by the Court of Appeals that at minimum implicated constitutional concerns.  We agree with the District Court that the original mandate was not so explicit as to compel that interpretation.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

PERCY HUTTON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 16–1116. Decided June 19, 2017\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Respondent Percy Hutton accused two friends, Derek\nMitchell and Samuel Simmons Jr., of stealing a sewing\nmachine, in which he had hidden $750. Mitchell and\nSimmons denied the accusation, but Hutton remained\nsuspicious. On the night of September 16, 1985, he lured\nthe pair into his car and, after pointing a gun at each,\ndrove them around town in search of the machine. By\nnight’s end, Hutton had recovered his sewing machine,\nSimmons was in the hospital with two gunshot wounds to\nthe head, and Mitchell was nowhere to be found. Sim-\nmons survived, but Mitchell was found dead a few weeks\nlater, also having been shot twice.\n  More than 30 years ago, an Ohio jury convicted Hutton\nof aggravated murder, attempted murder, and kidnaping.\nIn connection with the aggravated murder conviction, the\njury made two additional findings: that Hutton engaged in\n“a course of conduct involving the . . . attempt to kill two\nor more persons,” and that Hutton murdered Mitchell\nwhile “committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing im-\nmediately after . . . kidnapping,” Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n§§2929.04(A)(5), (7) (Lexis 1982). Because of these “ag-\ngravating circumstances,” Ohio law required that Hutton\nbe sentenced to “death, life imprisonment without parole,\n[or] life imprisonment with parole eligibility after” no\nfewer than 20 years in prison. §2929.03(C)(2).\n  Several days after rendering its verdict, the jury recon-\nvened for the penalty phase of the trial. The State argued\nfor the death penalty. In opposition, Hutton gave an\n2                   JENKINS v. HUTTON\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nunsworn statement professing his innocence and presented\nevidence about his background and psychological pro-\nfile. When the presentations concluded, the trial court\ninstructed the jury that it could recommend a death sen-\ntence only if it unanimously found that the State had\n“prove[d] beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating\ncircumstances, of which the Defendant was found guilty,\noutweigh[ed] the [mitigating factors].” State v. Hutton,\n100 Ohio St. 3d 176, 185, 2003-Ohio-5607, 797 N.E.2d\n948, 958; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2929.03(D)(2). The\njury deliberated and recommended death. The trial court\naccepted the recommendation after also finding, “beyond a\nreasonable doubt, . . . that the aggravating circumstances\n. . . outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors.” §2929.03(D)(3).\n    The Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court\naffirmed Hutton’s death sentence. In doing so, both con-\ncluded that “the evidence support[ed] the finding of the\naggravating circumstances.” §2929.05(A); see Hutton, 100\nOhio St. 3d, at 187, 797 N. E. 2d, at 961; State v. Hutton,\n72 Ohio App. 3d 348, 350, 594 N.E.2d 692, 694 (1995).\nThe courts also “independently weigh[ed] all of the facts\n. . . to determine whether the aggravating circumstances\n[Hutton] was found guilty of committing outweigh[ed] the\nmitigating factors.” Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2929.05(A).\nBoth agreed with the jury and the trial court that “aggra-\nvating circumstances outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors,”\nand that a death sentence was warranted. Hutton, 100\nOhio St. 3d, at 191, 797 N. E. 2d, at 963–964; see Hutton,\n72 Ohio App. 3d, at 352, 594 N. E. 2d, at 695.\n    The case before this Court concerns Hutton’s subse-\nquent petition for federal habeas relief. In 2005, Hutton\nfiled such a petition pursuant to 28 U.S. C. §2254, argu-\ning that the trial court violated his due process rights\nduring the penalty phase of his trial. According to Hutton,\nthe court gave the jurors insufficient guidance because it\nfailed to tell them that, when weighing aggravating and\n                 Cite as: 582 U. S. ____ (2017)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nmitigating factors, they could consider only the two aggra-\nvating factors they had found during the guilt phase.\nHutton, however, had not objected to the trial court’s\ninstruction or raised this argument on direct appeal, and\nthe District Court on federal habeas concluded that his\ndue process claim was procedurally defaulted. Hutton v.\nMitchell, 2013 WL 2476333, *64 (ND Ohio, June 7, 2013);\nsee State v. Hutton, 53 Ohio St. 3d 36, 39, n. 1, 559 N.E.\n2d 432, 437–438, n. 1 (1990) (declining to address trial\ncourt’s instructions because Hutton “specifically declined\nto object . . . at trial, and ha[d] not raised or briefed the\nissue” on appeal).\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nreversed. The court concluded that, notwithstanding the\nprocedural default, it could “reach the merits” of Hutton’s\nclaim to “avoid a fundamental miscarriage of justice.”\nHutton v. Mitchell, 839 F.3d 486, 498 (2016) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Sixth Circuit began its\nanalysis with Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333 (1992). In\nthat decision, this Court established that a habeas peti-\ntioner may obtain review of a defaulted claim upon\n“show[ing] by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a\nconstitutional error, no reasonable jury would have found\n[him] eligible for the death penalty under the applicable\nstate law.” Id., at 336.\n   Hutton had not argued that this exception to default\napplied to his case. Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit held\nthat the exception justified reviewing his claim. The court\ngave two reasons: First, Hutton was not eligible to receive\na death sentence because “the jury had not made the\nnecessary finding of the existence of aggravating circum-\nstances.” 839 F.3d, at 498–499. And second, since the\ntrial court “gave the jury no guidance as to what to con-\nsider as aggravating circumstances” when weighing aggra-\nvating and mitigating factors, the record did not show that\nthe jury’s death recommendation “was actually based on a\n4                   JENKINS v. HUTTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nreview of any valid aggravating circumstances.” Id., at\n500. On the merits, the court concluded that the trial\ncourt violated Hutton’s constitutional rights by giving an\nerroneous jury instruction. Judge Rogers dissented on the\nground that Hutton could not overcome the procedural\ndefault.\n   The Sixth Circuit was wrong to reach the merits of\nHutton’s claim. The court’s first reason for excusing de-\nfault was that “the jury had not [found] the existence of\naggravating circumstances.” Id., at 498–499. But it had,\nat the guilt phase of Hutton’s trial. As Judge Rogers\npointed out, “the jury found two such factors”—engaging\nin a course of conduct designed to kill multiple people and\ncommitting kidnaping—“in the process of convicting Hut-\nton . . . of aggravated murder.” Id., at 511. Each of those\nfindings “rendered Hutton eligible for the death penalty.”\nIbid. Hutton has not argued that the trial court improperly\ninstructed the jury about aggravating circumstances at\nthe guilt phase. Nor did the Sixth Circuit identify any\nsuch error. Instead, the instruction that Hutton contends\nis incorrect, and that the Sixth Circuit analyzed, was\ngiven at the penalty phase of trial. That penalty phase\ninstruction plainly had no effect on the jury’s decision—\ndelivered after the guilt phase and pursuant to an unchal-\nlenged instruction—that aggravating circumstances were\npresent when Hutton murdered Mitchell.\n   The Sixth Circuit’s second reason for reaching the mer-\nits rests on a legal error. Under Sawyer, a court may\nreview a procedurally defaulted claim if, “but for a consti-\ntutional error, no reasonable jury would have found the\npetitioner eligible for the death penalty.” 505 U.S., at 336\n(emphasis added). Here, the alleged error was the trial\ncourt’s failure to specify that, when weighing aggravating\nand mitigating factors, the jury could consider only the\naggravating circumstances it found at the guilt phase.\nAssuming such an error can provide a basis for excusing\ndefault, the Sixth Circuit should have considered the\n                  Cite as: 582 U. S. ____ (2017)            5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nfollowing: Whether, given proper instructions about the\ntwo aggravating circumstances, a reasonable jury could\nhave decided that those aggravating circumstances out-\nweighed the mitigating circumstances.\n   But the court did not ask that question. Instead, it\nconsidered whether, given the (alleged) improper instruc-\ntions, the jury might have been relying on invalid aggra-\nvating circumstances when it recommended a death sen-\ntence. See 839 F.3d, at 500 (explaining that, because the\ntrial court gave “no guidance as to what to consider as\naggravating circumstances,” the court could not determine\nwhether the death recommendation “was actually based\non a review of any valid aggravating circumstances”). The\ncourt, in other words, considered whether the alleged error\nmight have affected the jury’s verdict, not whether a\nproperly instructed jury could have recommended death.\nThat approach, which would justify excusing default\nwhenever an instructional error could have been relevant\nto a jury’s decision, is incompatible with Sawyer.\n   Neither Hutton nor the Sixth Circuit has “show[n] by\nclear and convincing evidence that”—if properly in-\nstructed—“no reasonable juror would have” concluded that\nthe aggravating circumstances in Hutton’s case outweigh\nthe mitigating circumstances. Sawyer, 505 U.S., at 336.\nIn fact, the trial court, Ohio Court of Appeals, and Ohio\nSupreme Court each independently weighed those factors\nand concluded that the death penalty was justified. On\nthe facts of this case, the Sixth Circuit was wrong to hold\nthat it could review Hutton’s claim under the miscarriage\nof justice exception to procedural default.\n   The petition for certiorari and motion for leave to pro-\nceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

JUVENILE MALE\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 09–940    Decided June 7, 2010 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   In 2005, respondent was charged in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Montana with juvenile\ndelinquency under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act\n(FJDA), 18 U.S. C. §5031 et seq. Respondent eventually\npleaded “true” to knowingly engaging in sexual acts with a\nperson under 12 years of age, which would have been a\ncrime under §§2241(c) and 1153(a) if committed by an\nadult. In June 2005, the District Court accepted respon\ndent’s plea and adjudged him delinquent. The court sen\ntenced respondent to two years’ official detention and\njuvenile delinquent supervision until his 21st birthday.\nThe court also ordered respondent to spend the first six\nmonths of his juvenile supervision in a prerelease center\nand to abide by the center’s conditions of residency.\n   In 2006, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registra\ntion and Notification Act (SORNA), 120 Stat. 590, 42\nU.S. C. §16901 et seq. With respect to juvenile offenders,\nSORNA requires individuals who have been adjudicated\ndelinquent for certain serious sex offenses to register and\nto keep their registrations current in each jurisdiction\nwhere they live, work, and go to school. §§16911(8);\n16913. In February 2007, the Attorney General issued an\ninterim rule specifying that SORNA’s requirements “apply\nto all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of\nthe offense for which registration is required prior to the\nenactment of [SORNA].” 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28\nCFR §72.3 (2009)).\n   In July 2007, the District Court revoked respondent’s\n2            UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\njuvenile supervision, finding that respondent had failed to\ncomply with the requirements of the prerelease program.\nThe court sentenced respondent to an additional 6-month\nterm of official detention, to be followed by a period of\nsupervision until his 21st birthday. The Government,\ninvoking SORNA’s juvenile registration provisions, argued\nthat respondent should be required to register as a sex\noffender, at least for the duration of his juvenile supervi\nsion. As “special conditions” of his supervision, the court\nordered respondent to register as a sex offender and to\nkeep his registration current. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.\n  The Ninth Circuit vacated the sex-offender-registration\nrequirements of the District Court’s order. 590 F.3d 924\n(2010). The Court of Appeals determined that “retroactive\napplication of SORNA’s provision covering individuals who\nwere adjudicated juvenile delinquents because of the\ncommission of certain sex offenses before SORNA’s pas\nsage violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United\nStates Constitution.” Id., at 927. The court thus held that\n“SORNA’s juvenile registration provision may not be\napplied retroactively to individuals adjudicated delinquent\nunder the [FJDA].” Id., at 928.\n  The United States asks us to grant certiorari to review\nthe Ninth Circuit’s determination that SORNA violates\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause as applied to individuals who\nwere adjudicated juvenile delinquents under the FJDA\nprior to SORNA’s enactment. Before we can address that\nquestion, however, we must resolve a threshold issue of\nmootness. Before the Ninth Circuit, respondent chal\nlenged only the conditions of his juvenile supervision\nrequiring him to register as a sex offender. But on May 2,\n2008, respondent’s term of supervision expired, and thus\nhe no longer is subject to those sex-offender-registration\nconditions. As such, this case likely is moot unless re\nspondent can show that a decision invalidating the sex\noffender-registration conditions of his juvenile supervision\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nwould be sufficiently likely to redress “collateral conse\nquences adequate to meet Article III’s injury-in-fact re\nquirement.” Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 14 (1998).\n  Perhaps the most likely potential “collateral conse\nquenc[e]” that might be remedied by a judgment in re\nspondent’s favor is the requirement that respondent re\nmain registered as a sex offender under Montana law.\n(“By the time of the court of appeals’ decision, respondent\nhad become registered as a sex offender in Montana,\nwhere he continues to be registered today.” Pet. for Cert.\n29.) We thus must know whether a favorable decision in\nthis case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent\n“could remove his name and identifying information from\nthe Montana sex offender registry.” Ibid. Therefore, we\ncertify the following question to the Supreme Court of\nMontana, pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Proce\ndure 15 (2009):\n    Is respondent’s duty to remain registered as a sex of\n    fender under Montana law contingent upon the valid\n    ity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juve\n    nile-supervision order that required him to register as\n    a sex offender, see Mont. Code Ann. §§46–23–\n    502(6)(b), 41–5–1513(1)(c) (2005); State v. Villanueva,\n    328 Mont. 135, 138–140, 118 P.3d 179, 181–182\n    (2005); see also §46–23–502(9)(b) (2009), or is the duty\n    an independent requirement of Montana law that is\n    unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal\n    juvenile-supervision conditions, see §46–23–502(10)\n    (2009); 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 483, §31, p. 2185?\n  We respectfully request that the Montana Supreme\nCourt accept our certified question. The court’s answer to\nthis question will help determine whether this case pre\nsents a live case or controversy, and there is no controlling\nappellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute on\npoint.

The State Supreme Court affirmed. In granting certiorari, this Court asked the parties to address the question whether petitioner properly raised in the State Supreme Court the federal claim that his death sentence is unconstitutional under Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 638.\nHeld: Because petitioner did not properly raise his federal claim in the State Supreme Court, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted. Petitioner's argument that he presented his federal claim by citing a state case, which cited another state case, which in turn cited Beck, presents a daisy chain too lengthy to meet this Court's standards for proper presentation of a federal claim. Nor was his federal claim raised by implication under a state-law rule similar to the constitutional rule articulated in Beck, because the state and federal standards are not identical. Finally, even if this Court's requirement that a federal claim be raised in state court is prudential rather than jurisdictional, \"the circumstances here justify no exception.\" Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 90 (per curiam).\nCertiorari dismissed. Reported below: 860 So. 2d 704.\nCERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSISSIPPI.\nRonnie Monroe Mitchell argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were André de Gruy, Duncan Lott, and William Odum Richardson, by appointment of the Court, 543 U. S. 977.\nJim Hood, Attorney General of Mississippi, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Judy Thomas Martin, Special Assistant Attorney General.*\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner Marlon Howell contends that the Mississippi courts violated his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by refusing to require a jury instruction about a lesser included offense in his capital case. He did not, however, raise this claim in the Supreme Court of Mississippi, which unsurprisingly did not address it. As a result, we dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner was convicted and sentenced to death for killing Hugh David Pernell. Shortly after 5 a.m. on May 15, 2000, Pernell was delivering newspapers from his car when the occupants of another car motioned for him to stop. The evidence at trial indicated that, when both cars had pulled over, petitioner got out of the trailing car and approached the driver's side of Pernell's car. After a brief conversation and perhaps some kind of scuffle, petitioner pulled out a pistol, shot Pernell through the heart, got back in the other car, and fled the scene. See 860 So. 2d 704, 712-715, 738-739 (Miss. 2003). At trial, petitioner argued both that he was in another city at the time of the killing and that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Pernell was killed during an attempted robbery (which would deprive the State of an element of capital murder). As part of his nonalibi defense, petitioner sought to supplement the State's proposed jury instruction on capital murder with instructions on manslaughter and simple murder. The trial court refused the additional instructions. The jury found petitioner guilty of capital murder and separately concluded that he should be sentenced to death.\n\n\n3\nOn appeal to the State Supreme Court, one of petitioner's 28 claims of error was the trial court's failure \"to give the defendant an instruction on the offense of simple murder or manslaughter.\" App. 39. In that argument, petitioner cited three cases from the State Supreme Court about lesser-included-offense instructions, and the only opinion whose original language he quoted was a noncapital case. Ibid. (quoting, with modifications, Conner v. State, 632 So. 2d 1239, 1254 (Miss. 1993) (a capital case), in turn quoting McGowan v. State, 541 So. 2d 1027, 1028 (Miss. 1989) (a noncapital case), in turn quoting Harper v. State, 478 So. 2d 1017, 1021 (Miss. 1985) (a noncapital case)). Petitioner argued that, because the jury \"could have found and returned the lesser included offense of simple murder or manslaughter,\" the failure to give instructions on those offenses was \"error\" that left the jury no \"choice but either to turn [him] loose or convict him of [c]apital [m]urder.\" App. 40. In the course of affirming petitioner's conviction and death sentence, the State Supreme Court found that \"[t]he facts of this case clearly do not support or warrant\" the instruction for manslaughter or simple murder. 860 So. 2d, at 744. The court cited and quoted a prior noncapital decision, which construed a state statute and concluded that an instruction should be refused if it would cause the jury to \"`ignore the primary charge'\" or \"`if the evidence does not justify submission of a lesser-included offense.'\" Ibid. (quoting Presley v. State, 321 So. 2d 309, 310-311 (Miss. 1975)). The court also cited Grace v. State, 375 So. 2d 419 (Miss. 1979), an aggravated-assault case rejecting an instruction for simple assault.\n\n\n4\nPetitioner sought certiorari from this Court, arguing that his death sentence is unconstitutional under that rule of our capital jurisprudence set forth in Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 638 (1980) (\"[I]f the unavailability of a lesser included offense instruction enhances the risk of an unwarranted conviction, [the State] is constitutionally prohibited from withdrawing that option from the jury in a capital case\"). See Pet. for Cert. 5. We granted certiorari, but asked the parties to address the following additional question: \"`Was petitioner's federal constitutional claim properly raised before the Mississippi Supreme Court for purposes of 28 U. S. C. § 1257?'\" 542 U. S. 936 (2004). Our answer to that question prevents us from reaching petitioner's constitutional claim.\n\n\n5\nCongress has given this Court the power to review \"[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had ... where any ... right ... is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of ... the United States.\" 28 U. S. C. § 1257(a) (emphasis added). Under that statute and its predecessors, this Court has almost unfailingly refused to consider any federal-law challenge to a state-court decision unless the federal claim \"was either addressed by or properly presented to the state court that rendered the decision we have been asked to review.\" Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 86 (1997) (per curiam); see also Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 218 (1983) (tracing this principle back to Crowell v. Randell, 10 Pet. 368, 392 (1836), and Owings v. Norwood's Lessee, 5 Cranch 344 (1809)).\n\n\n6\nPetitioner's brief in the State Supreme Court did not properly present his claim as one arising under federal law.1 In the relevant argument, he did not cite the Constitution or even any cases directly construing it, much less any of this Court's cases. Instead, he argues that he presented his federal claim by citing Harveston v. State, 493 So. 2d 365 (Miss. 1986), which cited (among other cases) Fairchild v. State, 459 So. 2d 793 (Miss. 1984), which in turn cited Beck, but only by way of acknowledging that Mississippi's general rule requiring lesser-included-offense instructions \"takes on constitutional proportions\" in capital cases. 459 So. 2d, at 800. Assuming it constituted adequate briefing of the federal question under state-law standards, petitioner's daisy chain — which depends upon a case that was cited by one of the cases that was cited by one of the cases that petitioner cited — is too lengthy to meet this Court's standards for proper presentation of a federal claim.2 As we recently explained in a slightly different context, \"[a] litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief ... by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim `federal.'\" Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 32 (2004). In the context of § 1257, the same steps toward clarity are just as easy to take and are generally necessary to establish that a federal question was properly presented to a state court. Petitioner did none of these things.\n\n\n7\nPetitioner also contends that he raised his federal claim by implication because the state-law rule on which he relied was \"identical,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 17, or \"virtually identical,\" Brief for Petitioner 17-18, to the constitutional rule articulated in Beck. Assuming, without deciding, that identical standards might overcome a petitioner's failure to identify his claim as federal, Mississippi's rule regarding lesser-included-offense instructions is not identical to Beck — or at least not identical to the Mississippi Supreme Court's interpretation of Beck. Mississippi's rule applies even when the jury is not choosing only between acquittal and death. The Mississippi Supreme Court's interpretation of Beck, on the other hand, holds that case inapplicable where the jury has the additional option of life imprisonment, see Jackson v. State, 684 So. 2d 1213, 1228 (1996) — a conclusion that finds some support in our cases, see Hopkins v. Reeves, 524 U. S. 88, 98 (1998) (\"In Beck, the death penalty was automatically tied to conviction, and Beck's jury was told that if it convicted the defendant of the charged offense, it was required to impose the death penalty\"); Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S. 624, 646 (1991) (\"Our fundamental concern in Beck was that a jury ... might ... vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to set the defendant free with no punishment at all\"). Moreover, unlike Beck, see 447 U. S., at 638, n. 14, Mississippi's rule on lesser-included-offense instructions applies in noncapital cases (as shown by the cases petitioner did cite). Thus, one opinion of the Mississippi Supreme Court appears to have treated a claim under Beck as distinct from one arising under the Mississippi rule. See Goodin v. State, 787 So. 2d 639, 656 (2001) (\"Having found no [federal] constitutional flaws in the jury instruction given, we must now determine whether our practice entitles Goodin to a manslaughter instruction. We have held that there must be some evidentiary support to grant an instruction for manslaughter\").\n\n\n8\nPetitioner suggests that we need not treat his failure to present his federal claim in state court as jurisdictional. Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, and n. 1. Notwithstanding the long line of cases clearly stating that the presentation requirement is jurisdictional, see, e.g., Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, 462 U. S. 176, 181, n. 3 (1983); Cardinale v. Louisiana, 394 U. S. 437, 438-439 (1969) (citing cases), a handful of exceptions (discussed in Gates, 462 U. S., at 219) have previously led us to conclude that this is \"an unsettled question.\" Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Crenshaw, 486 U. S. 71, 79 (1988). As in prior cases, however, we need not decide today \"whether our requirement that a federal claim be addressed or properly presented in state court is jurisdictional or prudential, because even treating the rule as purely prudential, the circumstances here justify no exception.\" Adams, 520 U. S., at 90 (citations omitted); accord, Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 533 (1992); Bankers Life, supra, at 79; Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 87 (1985); Gates, supra, at 222.3\n\n\n9\nAccordingly, we dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.\n\n\n10\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Kent S. Scheidegger filed a brief for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as amicus curiae.\n\n\n1\n Petitioner argues not that the State Supreme Court actually addressed his federal claim, but rather that it \"had an adequate opportunity to address\" it.

S. 83, 89, n. 3 (1997) (per curiam) (concluding that \"passing invocations of `due process'\" that \"fail to cite the Federal Constitution or any cases relying on the Fourteenth Amendment\" do not \"meet our minimal requirement that it must be clear that a federal claim was presented\"); Webb v.

NORTH CAROLINA\n       ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE\n\n           SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n              No. 14–593.   Decided March 30, 2015\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Petitioner Torrey Dale Grady was convicted in North\nCarolina trial courts of a second degree sexual offense in\n1997 and of taking indecent liberties with a child in 2006.\nAfter serving his sentence for the latter crime, Grady was\nordered to appear in New Hanover County Superior Court\nfor a hearing to determine whether he should be subjected\nto satellite-based monitoring (SBM) as a recidivist sex\noffender. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§14–208.40(a)(1), 14–\n208.40B (2013). Grady did not dispute that his prior\nconvictions rendered him a recidivist under the relevant\nNorth Carolina statutes. He argued, however, that the\nmonitoring program—under which he would be forced to\nwear tracking devices at all times—would violate his\nFourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. Unpersuaded, the trial court or-\ndered Grady to enroll in the program and be monitored for\nthe rest of his life. Record in No. COA13-958 (N. C. App.),\npp. 3–4, 18–22.\n  Grady renewed his Fourth Amendment challenge on\nappeal, relying on this Court’s decision in United States v.\nJones, 565 U. S. ___ (2012). In that case, this Court held\nthat police officers had engaged in a “search” within the\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment when they installed\nand monitored a Global Positioning System (GPS) track-\ning device on a suspect’s car. The North Carolina Court of\nAppeals rejected Grady’s argument, concluding that it was\nforeclosed by one of its earlier decisions. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 5a–7a. In that decision, coincidentally named State\n2                    GRADY v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nv. Jones, the court had said:\n     “Defendant essentially argues that if affixing a GPS to\n     an individual’s vehicle constitutes a search of the in-\n     dividual, then the arguably more intrusive act of affix-\n     ing an ankle bracelet to an individual must constitute\n     a search of the individual as well. We disagree. The\n     context presented in the instant case—which involves\n     a civil SBM proceeding—is readily distinguishable\n     from that presented in [United States v.] Jones, where\n     the Court considered the propriety of a search in the\n     context of a motion to suppress evidence. We con-\n     clude, therefore, that the specific holding in [United\n     States v.] Jones does not control in the case sub ju-\n     dice.” ___ N. C. App. ___, ___, 750 S.E.2d 883, 886\n     (2013).\n   The court in Grady’s case held itself bound by this rea-\nsoning and accordingly rejected his Fourth Amendment\nchallenge. App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a–7a. The North Caro-\nlina Supreme Court in turn summarily dismissed Grady’s\nappeal and denied his petition for discretionary review.\n367 N. C. 523, 762 S.E.2d 460 (2014). Grady now asks us\nto reverse these decisions.*\n   The only explanation provided below for the rejection of\nGrady’s challenge is the quoted passage from State v.\nJones. And the only theory we discern in that passage is\nthat the State’s system of nonconsensual satellite-based\nmonitoring does not entail a search within the meaning of\nthe Fourth Amendment. That theory is inconsistent with\n——————\n   * Grady aims his petition at the decisions of both North Carolina\nappellate courts. See Pet. for Cert. 1. Because we treat the North\nCarolina Supreme Court’s dismissal of an appeal for lack of a substan-\ntial constitutional question as a decision on the merits, it is that court’s\njudgment, rather than the judgment of the Court of Appeals, that is\nsubject to our review under 28 U.S. C. §1257(a). See R. J. Reynolds\nTobacco Co. v. Durham County, 479 U.S. 130, 138–139 (1986).\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthis Court’s precedents.\n   In United States v. Jones, we held that “the Govern-\nment’s installation of a GPS device on a target’s vehicle,\nand its use of that device to monitor the vehicle’s move-\nments, constitutes a ‘search.’ ” 565 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 3) (footnote omitted). We stressed the importance of the\nfact that the Government had “physically occupied private\nproperty for the purpose of obtaining information.” Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 4). Under such circumstances, it was not\nnecessary to inquire about the target’s expectation of\nprivacy in his vehicle’s movements in order to determine if\na Fourth Amendment search had occurred. “Where, as\nhere, the Government obtains information by physically\nintruding on a constitutionally protected area, such a\nsearch has undoubtedly occurred.” Id., at ___, n. 3 (slip\nop., at 6, n. 3).\n   We reaffirmed this principle in Florida v. Jardines, 569\nU. S. ___, ___–___ (2013) (slip op., at 3–4), where we held\nthat having a drug-sniffing dog nose around a suspect’s\nfront porch was a search, because police had “gathered . . .\ninformation by physically entering and occupying the\n[curtilage of the house] to engage in conduct not explicitly\nor implicitly permitted by the homeowner.” See also id., at\n___ (slip op., at 9) (a search occurs “when the government\ngains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally\nprotected areas”). In light of these decisions, it follows\nthat a State also conducts a search when it attaches a\ndevice to a person’s body, without consent, for the purpose\nof tracking that individual’s movements.\n   In concluding otherwise, the North Carolina Court of\nAppeals apparently placed decisive weight on the fact that\nthe State’s monitoring program is civil in nature. See\nJones, ___ N. C. App., at ___, 750 S. E. 2d, at 886 (“the\ninstant case . . . involves a civil SBM proceeding”). “It is\nwell settled,” however, “that the Fourth Amendment’s\nprotection extends beyond the sphere of criminal investi-\n4                GRADY v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ngations,” Ontario v. Quon, 560 U.S. 746, 755 (2010), and\nthe government’s purpose in collecting information does\nnot control whether the method of collection constitutes a\nsearch. A building inspector who enters a home simply to\nensure compliance with civil safety regulations has un-\ndoubtedly conducted a search under the Fourth Amend-\nment. See Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County\nof San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 534 (1967) (housing in-\nspections are “administrative searches” that must comply\nwith the Fourth Amendment).\n   In its brief in opposition to certiorari, the State faults\nGrady for failing to introduce “evidence about the State’s\nimplementation of the SBM program or what information,\nif any, it currently obtains through the monitoring pro-\ncess.” Brief in Opposition 11. Without evidence that it is\nacting to obtain information, the State argues, “there is no\nbasis upon which this Court can determine whether North\nCarolina conducts a ‘search’ of an offender enrolled in its\nSBM program.” Ibid. (citing Jones, 565 U. S., at ___, n. 5\n(slip op., at 7, n. 5) (noting that a government intrusion is\nnot a search unless “done to obtain information”)). In\nother words, the State argues that we cannot be sure its\nprogram for satellite-based monitoring of sex offenders\ncollects any information. If the very name of the program\ndoes not suffice to rebut this contention, the text of the\nstatute surely does:\n    “The satellite-based monitoring program shall use a\n    system that provides all of the following:\n      “(1) Time-correlated and continuous tracking of the\n    geographic location of the subject . . . .\n      “(2) Reporting of subject’s violations of prescriptive\n    and proscriptive schedule or location requirements.”\n    N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §14–208.40(c).\nThe State’s program is plainly designed to obtain infor-\nmation. And since it does so by physically intruding on a\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nsubject’s body, it effects a Fourth Amendment search.\n   That conclusion, however, does not decide the ultimate\nquestion of the program’s constitutionality. The Fourth\nAmendment prohibits only unreasonable searches. The\nreasonableness of a search depends on the totality of the\ncircumstances, including the nature and purpose of the\nsearch and the extent to which the search intrudes upon\nreasonable privacy expectations. See, e.g., Samson v.\nCalifornia, 547 U.S. 843 (2006) (suspicionless search of\nparolee was reasonable); Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.\nActon, 515 U.S. 646 (1995) (random drug testing of stu-\ndent athletes was reasonable). The North Carolina courts\ndid not examine whether the State’s monitoring program\nis reasonable—when properly viewed as a search—and we\nwill not do so in the first instance.\n   The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court of North Carolina is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

ROBERT COCCHI ET AL.\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT \n\n     COURT OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA, FOURTH DISTRICT\n\n            No. 10–1521. Decided November 7, 2011\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Agreements to arbitrate that fall within the scope and\ncoverage of the Federal Arbitration Act (Act), 9 U.S. C. §1\net seq., must be enforced in state and federal courts. State\ncourts, then, “have a prominent role to play as enforcers\nof agreements to arbitrate.” Vaden v. Discover Bank, 556\nU.S. 49, 59 (2009).\n   The Act has been interpreted to require that if a dispute\npresents multiple claims, some arbitrable and some not,\nthe former must be sent to arbitration even if this will\nlead to piecemeal litigation. See Dean Witter Reynolds\nInc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 217 (1985). From this it fol-\nlows that state and federal courts must examine with care\nthe complaints seeking to invoke their jurisdiction in order\nto separate arbitrable from nonarbitrable claims. A court\nmay not issue a blanket refusal to compel arbitration\nmerely on the grounds that some of the claims could be\nresolved by the court without arbitration. See ibid.\n   In this case the Fourth District Court of Appeal of the\nState of Florida upheld a trial court’s refusal to compel\narbitration of respondents’ claims after determining that\ntwo of the four claims in a complaint were nonarbitrable.\nThough the matter is not altogether free from doubt, a fair\nreading of the opinion indicates a likelihood that the Court\nof Appeal failed to determine whether the other two claims\nin the complaint were arbitrable. For this reason, the\njudgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case\nremanded for further proceedings.\n2                   KPMG LLP v. COCCHI\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n\n                          *    *   * \n\n   Respondents are 19 individuals and entities who bought\nlimited partnership interests in one of three limited part-\nnerships, all known as the Rye Funds. The Rye Funds\nwere managed by Tremont Group Holding, Inc., and\nTremont Partners, Inc., both of which were audited by\nKPMG. The Rye Funds were invested with financier\nBernard Madoff and allegedly lost millions of dollars as a\nresult of a scheme to defraud. Respondents sued the Rye\nFunds, the Tremont defendants, and Tremont’s auditing\nfirm, KPMG.\n   Only the claims against KPMG are at issue in this case.\nAgainst KPMG, respondents alleged four causes of action:\nnegligent misrepresentation; violation of the Florida De-\nceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA), Fla.\nStat. 501.201 et seq. (2010); professional malpractice; and\naiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. Respond-\nents’ basic theory was that KPMG failed to use proper\nauditing standards with respect to the financial state-\nments of the partnerships. These improper audits, re-\nspondents contend, led to “substantial misrepresentations”\nabout the health of the funds and resulted in respondents’\ninvestment losses. 51 So. 3d 1165, 1168 (Fla. App. 2010).\n   KPMG moved to compel arbitration based on the audit\nservices agreement that existed between it and the Trem-\nont defendants. That agreement provided that “[a]ny\ndispute or claim arising out of or relating to . . . the ser-\nvices provided [by KPMG] . . . (including any dispute or\nclaim involving any person or entity for whose benefit the\nservices in question are or were provided) shall be re-\nsolved” either by mediation or arbitration. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 63a. The Florida Circuit Court of the Fifteenth\nJudicial Circuit Palm Beach County denied the motion.\n   The Court of Appeal affirmed, noting that “[n]one of the\nplaintiffs . . . expressly assented in any fashion to [the\naudit services agreement] or the arbitration provision.” 51\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nSo. 3d, at 1168. Thus, the court found, the arbitration\nclause could only be enforced if respondents’ claims were\nderivative in that they arose from the services KPMG\nperformed for the Tremont defendants pursuant to the\naudit services agreement. Applying Delaware law, which\nboth parties agreed was applicable, the Court of Appeal\nconcluded that the negligent misrepresentation and the\nviolation of FDUTPA claims were direct rather than de-\nrivative. A fair reading of the opinion reveals nothing to\nsuggest that the court came to the same conclusion about\nthe professional malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty\nclaims. Indeed, the court said nothing about those claims\nat all. Finding “the arbitral agreement upon which KPMG\nrelied would not apply to the direct claims made by the\nindividual plaintiffs,” id., at 1167, the Court of Appeal\naffirmed the trial court’s denial of the motion to arbitrate.\n   Respondents have since amended their complaint to\nadd a fifth claim. Citing the Court of Appeal’s decision,\nthe trial court again denied KPMG’s motion to compel\narbitration.\n   The Federal Arbitration Act reflects an “emphatic fed-\neral policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.”\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,\n473 U.S. 614, 631 (1985); Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospi-\ntal v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24–25 (1983)\n(noting that “questions of arbitrability [must]. . . be ad-\ndressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favor-\ning arbitration”). This policy, as contained within the Act,\n“requires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to\narbitrate,” Dean Witter, supra, at 217, and “cannot possi-\nbly require the disregard of state law permitting arbitra-\ntion by or against nonparties to the written arbitration\nagreement,” Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S.\n624, 630, n. 5 (2009) (emphasis deleted). Both parties\nagree that whether the claims in the complaint are arbi-\ntrable turns on the question whether they must be deemed\n4                   KPMG LLP v. COCCHI\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndirect or derivative under Delaware law. That question of\nstate law is not at issue here. What is at issue is the\nCourt of Appeal’s apparent refusal to compel arbitration\non any of the four claims based solely on a finding that two\nof them, the claim of negligent misrepresentation and the\nalleged violation of the FDUTPA, were nonarbitrable.\n   In Dean Witter, the Court noted that the Act “provides\nthat written agreements to arbitrate controversies arising\nout of an existing contract ‘shall be valid, irrevocable, and\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in\nequity for the revocation of any contract.’ ” 470 U.S., at\n218 (quoting 9 U.S. C. §2). The Court found that by its\nterms, “the Act leaves no place for the exercise of discre-\ntion by a district court, but instead mandates that district\ncourts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on\nissues as to which an arbitration agreement has been\nsigned.” 470 U.S., at 218 (emphasis in original). Thus,\nwhen a complaint contains both arbitrable and nonarbi-\ntrable claims, the Act requires courts to “compel arbitra-\ntion of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties\nfiles a motion to compel, even where the result would be\nthe possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceed-\nings in different forums.” Id., at 217. To implement this\nholding, courts must examine a complaint with care to\nassess whether any individual claim must be arbitrated.\nThe failure to do so is subject to immediate review. See\nSouthland Corp. v.

Dziewit.\nNo. 92-1988.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nApril 4, 1994.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nFor the reasons discussed below, we have concluded that deciding this case would require us to resolve a constitutional question that may be entirely hypothetical, and we accordingly dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.\n\n\n2\n* In 1985, the Federal Trade Commission initiated enforcement proceedings against petitioners, six title insurance companies, alleging that they conspired to fix prices in 13 States including Arizona and Wisconsin.  Shortly after that, private parties in the affected States filed 12 different \"tag-along\" antitrust class actions, seeking treble damages and injunctive relief.  Those private suits were consolidated for pretrial purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407 (the federal multidistrict litigation statute), and were transferred to the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as MDL No. 633.\n\n\n3\nIn January 1986, spurred on by an intervening decision of this Court that substantially weakened the claims against petitioners, see Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 105 S.Ct. 1721, 85 L.Ed.2d 36 (1985), petitioners and the class representatives in MDL No. 633 reached a settlement.  The settlement extinguished all money damages claims against petitioners by those \" 'purchasers and insureds, who purchased or received title insurance . . . from any title insurance underwriter . . . with respect to real estate located in any of the thirteen Affected States during the period from January 1, 1981 to December 31, 1985,' \" a class that included the respondents.  In re Real Estate Title and Settlement Services Antitrust Litigation, 1986-1 Trade Cases ¶ 67,149, pp. 62,921, 62,924, 1986 WL 6531 (ED Pa.1986) (quoting settlement agreement). To the plaintiffs, the settlement agreement awarded injunctive relief, an increased amount of coverage on any title insurance policy that class members bought during the class period, an increased amount of coverage on specified title insurance policies that class members might purchase from petitioners during a future 1-year period, and payment of attorney's fees and costs of the lawsuit.  The District Court provisionally certified the settlement class (as stipulated by the class representatives and petitioners) under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), and provisionally accepted the settlement.\n\n\n4\nAt the ensuing final settlement hearing, the State of Wisconsin objected to the proposed settlement both as a class member and as parens patriae for its resident class members, claiming that the action could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) because the relief sought in the complaints was primarily monetary.  Wisconsin also claimed (and was joined in this by the State of Arizona, both as a class member and as parens patriae) that due process required that the proposed class members have an opportunity to opt out of the class.  The District Court ultimately rejected these objections, certified the classes under Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2),* and accepted the settlement.  The Third Circuit affirmed without opinion, In re Real Estate Title and Settlement Services Antitrust Litigation, 815 F.2d 695 (1987) (judgment order), and we denied certiorari, 485 U.S. 909, 108 S.Ct. 1085, 99 L.Ed.2d 243 (1988).\n\n\n5\nIn 1990, respondent Brown filed the present action in District Court in Arizona on behalf of Arizona and Wisconsin title insurance consumers, alleging that petitioners had conspired to fix rates for title-search services in those States in violation of the federal antitrust laws.  The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment on the ground, among others, that respondents, as parties to the MDL No. 633 suit, were bound by the judgment entered pursuant to the settlement.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, accepting respondents' contention that it would violate due process to accord res judicata effect to a judgment in a class action that involved money damages claims (or perhaps that involved primarily money damages claims), against a plaintiff in the previous suit who had not been afforded a right to opt out on those claims.  982 F.2d 386, 392 (CA9 1992).  Before the Ninth Circuit, respondents did not (and indeed could not) challenge whether the class in the MDL No. 633 litigation was properly certified under Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2).  And in this Court, petitioners present only a single question—viz., \"[w]hether a federal court may refuse to enforce a prior federal class action judgment, properly certified under Rule 23, on grounds that absent class members have a constitutional due process right to opt out of any class action which asserts monetary claims on their behalf.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.\n\nII\n\n6\nThat certified question is of no general consequence if, whether or not absent class members have a constitutional right to opt out of such actions, they have a right to do so under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Such a right would exist if, in actions seeking monetary damages, classes can be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), which permits opt-out, and not under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), which do not.  See Rules 23(c)(2) and (c)(3). That is at least a substantial possibility—and we would normally resolve that preliminary nonconstitutional question before proceeding to the constitutional claim.  See New York City Transit Authority v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568, 582-583, 99 S.Ct. 1355, 1364, 59 L.Ed.2d 587 (1979).  The law of res judicata, however, prevents that question from being litigated here.  It was conclusively determined in the MDL No. 633 litigation that respondents' class fit within Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2);  even though that determination may have been wrong, it is conclusive upon these parties, and the alternative of using the Federal Rules instead of the Constitution as the means of imposing an opt-out requirement for this settlement is no longer available.\n\n\n7\nThe most obvious consequence of this unavailability is, as we have suggested, that our resolution of the posited constitutional question may be quite unnecessary in law, and of virtually no practical consequence in fact, except with respect to these particular litigants.  Another consequence, less apparent, is that resolving the constitutional question on the assumption of proper certification under the Rules may lead us to the wrong result. If the Federal Rules, which generally are not affirmatively enacted into law by Congress, see 28 U.S.C. §§ 2072(a), (b), 2074(a), are not entitled to that great deference as to constitutionality which we accord federal statutes, see, e.g., Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 64, 101 S.Ct. 2646, 2651, 69 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981);  Walters v. National Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 319-320, 105 S.Ct. 3180, 3188, 87 L.Ed.2d 220 (1985), they at least come with the imprimatur of the rulemaking authority of this Court.  In deciding the present case, we must assume either that the lack of opt-out opportunity in these circumstances was decreed by the Rules or that it was not (though the parties are bound by an erroneous holding that it was).  If we make the former assumption we may approve, in the mistaken deference to prior Supreme Court action and congressional acquiescence, action that neither we nor Congress would independently think constitutional.  If we make the latter assumption, we may announce a constitutional rule that is good for no other federal class action.  Neither option is attractive.\n\n\n8\nThe one reason to proceed is to achieve justice in this particular case.  Even if the constitutional question presented is hypothetical as to everyone else, it would seem to be of great practical importance to these litigants.  But that is ordinarily not sufficient reason for our granting certiorari—even when unnecessary constitutional pronouncements are not in the picture. Moreover, as matters have developed it is not clear that our resolution of the constitutional question will make any difference even to these litigants.  On the day we granted certiorari we were informed that the parties had reached a settlement designed to moot the petition, which now awaits the approval of the District Court.\n\n\n9\nIn these circumstances, we think it best to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.\n\n\n10\nJustice O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY join, dissenting.\n\n\n11\nWe granted certiorari to consider one specific question: \"Whether a federal court may refuse to enforce a prior federal class action judgment, properly certified under Rule 23, on grounds that absent class members have a constitutional due process right to opt out of any class action which asserts monetary claims on their behalf.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  The Court decides not to answer this question based on its speculation about a nonconstitutional ground for decision that is neither presented on this record nor available to these parties.  From that decision I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n12\nRespondents are members of a class that reached a final settlement with petitioners in an antitrust action styled MDL 633. In re Real Estate Title and Settlement Services Antitrust Litigation, 1986-1 Trade Cases ¶ 67,149, p. 62,921, 1986 WL 6531 (ED Pa.1986), aff'd, 815 F.2d 696 (CA3 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 909, 108 S.Ct. 1085, 99 L.Ed.2d 243 (1988).  Respondents subsequently brought this action against petitioners, asserting some of the same claims.  The District Court held that respondents had been adequately represented in the MDL 633 action, and granted summary judgment for petitioners because, given the identity of parties and claims, the MDL 633 settlement was res judicata.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a-28a.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  982 F.2d 386 (1992).  The court agreed that respondents had been adequately represented in the MDL 633 action, id., at 390-391, but held that respondents could nevertheless relitigate the same claims against petitioners:  \"Because [respondents] had no opportunity to opt out of the MDL 633 litigation, we hold there would be a violation of minimal due process if [respondents'] damage claims were held barred by res judicata.\"  Id., at 392.\n\n\n13\nThe Court concludes that the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's constitutional interpretation \"is of no general consequence if, . . . in actions seeking monetary damages, classes can be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), which permits opt-out, and not under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), which do not.\"  Ante, at ____. In other words, the Court declines to answer the constitutional question because the MDL 633 action might not have been properly certified—an issue that was litigated to a final determination in petitioners' favor more than five years ago, and on which we denied certiorari.  The nonconstitutional ground for decision about which the Court speculates is therefore unavailable to respondents.  The constitutional ground on which the Court of Appeals relied, the one we granted certiorari to review and the parties have briefed and argued, was necessary to the decision in this case.  Our prudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions has no application in these circumstances, and the Court errs in relying on it.\n\n\n14\nThe Court's assertion that \"our resolution of the posited constitutional question may be . . . of virtually no practical consequence in fact,\" ante, at ____, is unsound.  The lower courts have consistently held that the presence of monetary damage claims does not preclude class certification under Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2).  See 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d § 1775, pp. 463-470 (1986 and Supp.1992).  Whether or not those decisions are correct (a question we need not, and indeed should not, decide today), they at least indicate that there are a substantial number of class members in exactly the same position as respondents.  Under the Ninth Circuit's rationale in this case, every one of them has the right to go into federal court and relitigate their claims against the defendants in the original action.  The individuals, corporations, and governments that have successfully defended against class actions or reached appropriate settlements, but are now subject to relitigation of the same claims with individual class members, will rightly dispute the Court's characterization of the constitutional rule in this case as inconsequential.\n\n\n15\nThe Court is likewise incorrect in suggesting that a decision in this case \"may be quite unnecessary in law.\"  Ante, at ____. Unless and until a contrary rule is adopted, courts will continue to certify classes under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) notwithstanding the presence of damage claims;  the constitutional opt-out right announced by the court below will be implicated in every such action, at least in the Ninth Circuit.  Moreover, because the decision below is based on the Due Process Clause, presumably it applies to the States;  although we held in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 105 S.Ct. 2965, 86 L.Ed.2d 628 (1985), that there is a constitutional right to opt out of class actions brought in state court, that holding was expressly \"limited to those class actions which seek to bind known plaintiffs concerning claims wholly or predominately for money judgments.\"  Id., at 811, n. 3, 105 S.Ct., at 2974, n. 3.  The Ninth Circuit's rule, by contrast, applies whenever \"substantial damage claims\" are asserted.  See 982 F.2d, at 392.  The resolution of a constitutional issue with such broad-ranging consequences is both necessary and appropriate.\n\n\n16\nFinally, I do not agree with the Court's suggestion that the posture of the case could \"lead us to the wrong result\" with respect to the question whether the Due Process Clause requires an opt-out right in federal class actions involving claims for money damages.  See ante, at ____. As the case comes to us, we must assume that the MDL 633 class was properly certified under Rule 23, notwithstanding the presence of claims for monetary relief. But this assumption, coupled with whatever presumption of constitutionality to which the Rules are entitled, will not lead us to \"approve . . . action that neither we nor Congress would independently think constitutional.\"  Ante, at ____. Either an opt-out right is constitutionally required, or it isn't.  We can decide this issue while reserving the question of how the Rules should be construed.  While it might be convenient, and it would certainly accord with our usual practice, to decide the nonconstitutional question first, that option is not available to us in this case.  The only question, then, is whether we should dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  In my view, the importance of the constitutional question, as well as the significant expenditures of resources by the litigants, amici, and this Court, outweighs the prudential concerns on which the Court relies.\n\n\n17\nWhen a constitutional issue is fairly joined, necessary to the decision, and important enough to warrant review, this Court should not avoid resolving it—particularly on the basis of an entirely speculative alternate ground for decision that is neither presented by the record nor available to the parties before the Court.  The decision below rests exclusively on a constitutional right to opt out of class actions asserting claims for monetary relief.  We granted certiorari to consider whether such a right exists.  The issue has been thoroughly briefed and argued by the parties.  We should decide it.\n\n\n\n*\n Certification under Rule 23(b)(1)(A) requires that the prosecution of separate actions would create a risk of \"inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class.\"  Certification under Rule 23(b)(2) requires that \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\"\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

TIMOTHY ETHERTON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 15–723.    Decided April 4, 2016\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   In the fall of 2006, Michigan law enforcement received\nan anonymous tip that two white males were traveling on\nI–96 between Detroit and Grand Rapids in a white Audi,\npossibly carrying cocaine. Officers spotted a vehicle\nmatching that description and pulled it over for speeding.\nRespondent Timothy Etherton was driving; Ryan Pollie\nwas in the passenger seat. A search of the car uncovered\n125.2 grams of cocaine in a compartment at the bottom of\nthe driver side door. Both Etherton and Pollie were\narrested.\n   Etherton was tried in state court on a single count of\npossession with intent to deliver cocaine. At trial the facts\nreflected in the tip were not contested. The central point\nof contention was instead whether the cocaine belonged to\nEtherton or Pollie. Pollie testified for the prosecution\npursuant to a plea agreement. He claimed that he had\naccompanied Etherton from Grand Rapids to Detroit, not\nknowing that Etherton intended to obtain cocaine there.\nAccording to Pollie, once the pair arrived in Detroit,\nEtherton left him alone at a restaurant and drove off,\nreturning some 45 minutes later. It was only after they\nwere headed back to Grand Rapids that Etherton revealed\nhe had obtained the drugs.\n   The prosecution also called several police officers to\ntestify. Three of the officers described the content of the\nanonymous tip leading to Etherton’s arrest. On the third\nrecounting of the tip, Etherton’s counsel objected on hear-\nsay grounds, but the objection was not resolved when the\n2                   WOODS v. ETHERTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nprosecutor agreed to move on. At closing, the prosecutor\nalso described the tip. The court instructed the jury that\n“the tip was not evidence,” but was admitted “only to show\nwhy the police did what they did.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n88a. The jury convicted Etherton, and his conviction was\naffirmed on direct appeal. The Michigan Supreme Court\ndenied leave to appeal. People v. Etherton, 483 Mich. 896,\n760 N.W.2d 472 (2009).\n  Etherton sought postconviction relief in state court on\nsix grounds. Three are relevant here: First, he claimed\nthat the admission of the anonymous tip violated his\nrights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment. Second, that his trial counsel was ineffective\nfor failing to object to the tip on that ground. And third,\nthat his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective for failing\nto raise the Confrontation Clause and the ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel claims.\n  The state habeas court rejected the first two claims on\nprocedural grounds and the third on the merits. To pre-\nvail on a claim for ineffective assistance of appellate coun-\nsel, the state court explained, Etherton had to demon-\nstrate that “appellate counsel’s decision not to pursue an\nissue on appeal fell below an objective standard of reason-\nableness and that the representation so prejudiced [him]\nas to deprive him of a fair trial.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n87a–88a. The state court concluded that Etherton failed\non both counts.\n  First, the court reasoned, appellate counsel may have\nreasonably forgone any Confrontation Clause claim after\nconcluding that trial counsel’s failure to object was the\nproduct not of ineffectiveness but of strategy. While\nEtherton’s current counsel argues that trial counsel\nshould have objected because the tip’s reference to “two\nmen” suggested involvement by Etherton from the outset,\nBrief in Opposition 20–21, the reference also suggested\nPollie’s prior involvement, contrary to his testimony that\n                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nhe was not with Etherton when he picked up the cocaine\nand had nothing to do with it. As the state court ex-\nplained, not objecting would have been consistent with\ntrial counsel’s “strategy to show defendant’s non-\ninvolvement and possible responsibility of the passenger\n(who was also charged).” App. to Pet. for Cert. 88a.\n   Second, the court determined, Etherton had not been\nprejudiced by counsel’s choice: there was “ample evidence”\nof his guilt and “the complained of errors, even if true,\nwould not have changed the outcome” of the case. Id., at\n89a. Etherton’s allegations, the court concluded, ultimately\nfailed to overcome the presumption that his appellate\ncounsel functioned reasonably in not pursuing the Con-\nfrontation Clause or ineffectiveness claims. Ibid. Both\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme\nCourt denied leave to appeal.\n   Etherton next sought federal habeas relief. Under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), federal habeas relief was available to him only\nif the state court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved\nan unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.” 28 U.S. C. §2254(d)(1). “A state court’s determi-\nnation that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas\nrelief so long as ‘fairminded jurists could disagree’ on the\ncorrectness of the state court’s decision.” Harrington v.\nRichter, 562 U.S. 86, 101 (2011) (quoting Yarborough v.\nAlvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004)). The state court\ndecision must be “so lacking in justification that there was\nan error well understood and comprehended in existing\nlaw beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”\nWhite v. Woodall, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   When the claim at issue is one for ineffective assistance\nof counsel, moreover, AEDPA review is “doubly deferen-\ntial,” Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 190 (2011), be-\n4                  WOODS v. ETHERTON\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\ncause counsel is “strongly presumed to have rendered\nadequate assistance and made all significant decisions in\nthe exercise of reasonable professional judgment,” Burt v.\nTitlow, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9) (quoting\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 690 (1984); in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). In such circumstances,\nfederal courts are to afford “both the state court and the\ndefense attorney the benefit of the doubt.” Burt, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 1).\n  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Ap-\npeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed in relevant part, over\nthe dissent of Judge Kethledge. The majority concluded\nthat Etherton’s appellate counsel had been constitution-\nally ineffective, and that no fairminded jurist could con-\nclude otherwise. Etherton v. Rivard, 800 F.3d 737 (2015).\nWithout ruling on the merits of the court’s holding that\ncounsel had been ineffective, we disagree with the deter-\nmination that no fairminded jurist could reach a contrary\nconclusion, and accordingly reverse.\n  In finding counsel ineffective, the majority first con-\ncluded that Etherton’s right to confrontation had been vio-\nlated. The Confrontation Clause prohibits an out-of-court\nstatement only if it is admitted for its truth. Crawford v.\nWashington, 541 U.S. 36, 60, n. 9 (2004). The Sixth Cir-\ncuit determined that the contents of the tip were admitted\nfor their truth because the tip was referenced by three\ndifferent witnesses and mentioned in closing argument.\nThese “repeated references both to the existence and the\ndetails of the content of the tip went far beyond what was\nnecessary for background,” the majority below concluded,\n“indicating the content of the tip was admitted for its\ntruth.” 800 F.3d, at 751.\n  The majority next found that Etherton had been preju-\ndiced by the violation, a showing Etherton’s state court\ncounsel would have had to make on appeal to obtain relief\neither on the forfeited Confrontation Clause objection, see\n                  Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)              5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nPeople v. Carines, 460 Mich. 750, 763–764, 597 N.W.2d\n130, 138–139 (1999) (showing of prejudice required to\novercome forfeiture), or the ineffectiveness claim, Strick-\nland, supra, at 687 (showing of prejudice required to\ndemonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel). In finding\nprejudice, the majority acknowledged the evidence of\nEtherton’s guilt: the cocaine was found in a driver side\ncompartment inches from Etherton; he owned the car; and\nhe was driving at the time of arrest. But, according to the\nmajority, that evidence was not enough to convict Ether-\nton absent Pollie’s testimony. And that is where the tip\ncame in. “Because much of Pollie’s testimony was reflect-\ned in the content of the tip that was put before the jury,”\nthe Sixth Circuit stated, “the jury could have improperly\nconcluded that Pollie was thereby testifying truthfully—\nthat it was unlikely for it to be a coincidence for his testi-\nmony to line up so well with the anonymous accusation.”\n800 F.3d, at 753.\n   In reaching these conclusions, the Sixth Circuit did not\napply the appropriate standard of review under AEDPA.\nA “fairminded jurist” could conclude that repetition of the\ntip did not establish that the uncontested facts it conveyed\nwere submitted for their truth. Such a jurist might reach\nthat conclusion by placing weight on the fact that the\ntruth of the facts was not disputed. No precedent of this\nCourt clearly forecloses that view. It is also not beyond\nthe realm of possibility that a fairminded jurist could\nconclude that Etherton was not prejudiced when the tip\nand Pollie’s testimony corresponded on uncontested facts.\nAfter all, Pollie himself was privy to all the information\ncontained in the tip. A reasonable judge might accord-\ningly regard the fact that the tip and Pollie’s testimony corre-\nsponded to be unremarkable and not pertinent to Pollie’s\ncredibility. (In fact, the only point of Pollie’s testimony\nactually reflected in the tip was that he and Etherton were\ntraveling between Detroit and Grand Rapids.)\n6                  WOODS v. ETHERTON\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n   Etherton’s underlying complaint is that his appellate\nlawyer’s ineffectiveness meant he had “no prior opportu-\nnity to cross-examine the anonymous tipster.” Brief in\nOpposition 11. But it would not be objectively unreason-\nable for a fairminded judge to conclude—especially in light\nof the deference afforded trial counsel under Strickland—\nthat the failure to raise such a claim was not due to in-\ncompetence but because the facts in the tip were uncon-\ntested and in any event consistent with Etherton’s de-\nfense. See Harrington, 562 U.S., at 105 (“Even under\nde novo review, the standard for judging counsel’s repre-\nsentation is a most deferential one.”). A fairminded jurist\ncould similarly conclude, again deferring under Strick-\nland, that appellate counsel was not incompetent in draw-\ning the same conclusion. And to reach the final point at\nissue before the Sixth Circuit, a fairminded jurist—\napplying the deference due the state court under AEDPA—\ncould certainly conclude that the court was not objectively\nunreasonable in deciding that appellate counsel was not\nincompetent under Strickland, when she determined that\ntrial counsel was not incompetent under Strickland.\n   Given AEDPA, both Etherton’s appellate counsel and\nthe state habeas court were to be afforded the benefit of\nthe doubt.

SHALALA, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\nNo. 97 1489\nFebruary 23, 1999\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\nJustice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nUnder the Medicare Act, Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 290, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1395 (1994 ed. and Sup. II), et seq., the Secretary of Health and Human Services reimburses the providers of covered health services to Medicare beneficiaries, see §§1395f(b)(1), 1395h, 1395x(v)(1)(A). A provider seeking such reimbursement submits a yearly cost report to a fiscal intermediary (generally a private insurance company) that acts as the Secretary's agent. See 42 CFR § 405.1801(b) (1997). The intermediary analyzes the cost report and issues a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR) determining the amount of reimbursement to which the provider is entitled for the year.  See §405.1803.\n\n\n2\nAs is relevant here, a dissatisfied provider has two ways to get this determination revised. First, a provision of the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo, allows a provider to appeal, within 180 days, to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (Board) an administrative review panel that has the power to conduct an evidentiary hearing and affirm, modify, or reverse the  intermediary's NPR determination. The Board's decision is subject to judicial review infederal district court. §1395oo(f). Second, one of the Secretary's regulations, 42 CFR § 405.1885 (1997), permits a provider to request the intermediary, within  three years, to reopen the reimbursement determination.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc., owns and operates several entities that provide home health care services to Medicare beneficiaries. Petitioner submitted cost reports for the year 1989 to its fiscal intermediary, and did not seek administrative review of the resulting NPRs within 180 days. Within three years, however, it did ask the intermediary to reopen its 1989 reimbursement determination on the ground that \"new and material\" evidence demonstrated entitlement to additional compensation. The intermediary denied the request. Petitioner sought to appeal that denial to the Board, but the Board dismissed the appeal on the ground that §405.1885 divested it of jurisdiction to review an intermediary's refusal to reopen a reimbursement determination.\n\n\n4\nPetitioner then brought the instant action in Federal District Court, seeking review of the Board's dismissal and of the intermediary's refusal to reopen. In an unpublished opinion, the District Court agreed that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review the refusal to reopen, and rejected petitioner's alternative contention that the federal-question statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 or the mandamus statute, §1361, gave the District Court jurisdiction to review the intermediary's refusal directly. It accordingly dismissed the complaint. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 132 F.3d 1135 (CA6 1997). We granted certiorari. 524 U.S. ___ (1998).\n\n\n5\n* The primary issue in this case is whether the Board has jurisdiction to review a fiscal intermediary's refusal to reopen a reimbursement determination. The regulation that authorizes reopening provides that \"[j]urisdiction for reopening a determination   rests exclusively with that administrative body that rendered the last determination or decision.\" 42 CFR § 405.1885(c) (1997). In this litigation, the Secretary defends the position set forth in the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual §2926, App. A, ¶B.4 (Sept. 1993): \"A refusal by the intermediary to grant a reopening requested by the provider is not appealable to the Board, pursuant to 42 CFR § 405.1885(c) . . . .\"1 The Secretary construes the regulation to mean that where, as here, the intermediary is the body that rendered the last determination with respect to the cost reports at issue, review by the Board of the intermediary's refusal to reopen would divest the intermediary of its \"exclusiv[e]\" \"jurisdiction for reopening a determination.\" Petitioner, on the other hand, contends that \"jurisdiction\" in §405.1885(c) refers only to original jurisdiction over the reopening question, and not to appellate jurisdiction to review the intermediary's refusal. Even if it should win on this point, however, petitioner would only establish that the Board's otherwise extant appellate jurisdiction has not been excluded; it would still have to establish that the Board's appellate jurisdiction is somewhere conferred. Another regulation, §405.1889, says that an intermediary's affirmative decision to reopen and revise a reimbursement determination \"shall be considered a separate and distinct determination\" to which the regulations authorizing appeal to the Board are applicable; but it says nothing about appeal of a refusal to reopen. Petitioner must thus establish the Board's appellate jurisdiction on the basis of the unelaborated text of the Medicare Act itself.\n\n\n6\nPetitioner relies upon 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(a)(1)(A)(i), which says that a provider may obtain a hearing before the Board with respect to a cost report if the provider \"is dissatisfied with a final determination of   its fiscal intermediary   as to the amount of total program reimbursement due the provider   for the period covered by such report   .\" Petitioner maintains that the refusal to reopen a reimbursement determination constitutes a separate \"final determination   as to the amount of total program reimbursement due the provider.\" The Secretary, on the other hand, maintains that this phrase does not include a refusal to reopen, which is not a \"final determination . . . as to the amount,\" but rather the refusal to make a new determination. The Secretary's reading of §1395oo(a)(1)(A)(i) frankly seems to us the more natural but it is in any event well within the bounds of reasonable interpretation, and hence entitled to deference under Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,842 (1984).\n\n\n7\nThe reasonableness of the Secretary's construction of the statute is further confirmed by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977), in which we held that §205(g) of the Social Security Act does not authorize judicial review of the Secretary's decision not to reopen a previously adjudicated claim for benefits.2 In reaching this conclusion we relied, in part, upon two considerations: that the opportunity to reopen a benefit adjudication was afforded only by regulation and not by the Social Security Act itself; and that judicial review of a reopening denial would frustrate the statutory purpose of imposing a 60-day limit on judicial review of the Secretary's final decision on an initial claim for benefits. Id., at 108. Similar considerations apply here. The right of a provider to seek reopening exists only by grace of the Secretary, and the statutory purpose of imposing a 180-day limit on the right to seek Board review of NPRs, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(a)(3), would be frustrated by permitting requests to reopen to be reviewed indefinitely.\n\n\n8\nFinally, we do not think that the Secretary's position is inconsistent with 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii), which provides that the Secretary's cost-reimbursement regulations shall \"provide for the making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive.\" Petitioner asserts that the reopening regulations, as construed by the Secretary, do not create a \"suitable\" procedure for making \"retroactive corrective adjustments\" because an intermediary's refusal to reopen a determination is not subject to administrative review. In support of this assertion, petitioner decries the \"double standard\" inherent in a procedure that allows the intermediary to reopen (during the 3-year period) for the purpose of recouping overpayments, but to deny reopening when alleged underpayments are at issue.\n\n\n9\nThis argument fails for two reasons. First, and most importantly, petitioner's construction of §1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii) is inconsistent with our decision in Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402 (1993), in which we held that the Secretary reasonably construed clause (ii) to refer to the year-end reconciliation of monthly payments to providers, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395g with the total amount of program reimbursement determined by the intermediary. Although we did not specifically consider the procedure for reopening determinations after the year's books are closed, we think our conclusion there that clause (ii) refers to the year-end book balancing forecloses petitioner's contention that clause (ii) requires any particular procedure for reopening reimbursement determinations. And second, the procedures for obtaining reimbursement would not be \"unsuitable\" simply because an intermediary's refusal to reopen is not administratively reviewable. Medicare providers already have the right under §1395oo(a) (3) to appeal an intermediary's reimbursement determination to the Board. Title 42 CFR § 405.1885 (1997) generously gives them a second chance to get the decision changed this time at the hands of the intermediary itself, but without the benefit of administrative review. That is a \"suitable\" procedure, especially in light of the traditional rule of administrative law that an agency's refusal to reopen a closed case is generally \" 'committed to agency discretion by law' \" and therefore exempt from judicial review. See ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S. 270, 282 (1987). As for the alleged \"double standard,\" given the administrative realities we would not be shocked by a system in which underpayments could never be the basis for reopening. The few dozen fiscal intermediaries often need three years within which to discover overpayments in the tens of thousands of NPRs that they issue, while each of the tens of thousands of sophisticated Medicare-provider recipients of these NPRs is generally capable of identifying an underpayment in its own NPR within the 180-day time period specified in 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(a)(3). Petitioner's invocation of gross unfairness is also refuted by the Secretary's representation that fiscal intermediaries grant between 30 and 40 percent of providers' requests to reopen reimbursement determinations. Brief for Respondent 27, n. 11.\n\nII\n\n10\nWe also reject petitioner's fallback argument that it is entitled to judicial review of the intermediary's refusal to reopen. First, judicial review under the federal-question statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is precluded by 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), applicable to the Medicare Act by operation of §1395ii, which provides that \"[n]o action against   the [Secretary] or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331   of title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.\" Petitioner's claim \"arises under\" the Medicare Act within the meaning of this provision because \" 'both the standing and the substantive basis for the presentation' \" of the claim are the Medicare Act. Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 615 (1984).\n\n\n11\nSecond, the lower courts properly declined to issue mandamus to order petitioner's fiscal intermediary to reopen its 1989 reimbursement determination. Even if mandamus were available for claims arising under the Social Security and Medicare Acts,3 petitioner would still not be entitled to mandamus relief because it has not shown the existence of a \"clear nondiscretionary duty,\" Ringer, supra, at 617, to reopen the reimbursement determination at issue. The reopening regulations  do not require reopening, but merely permit it: \"A determination of an intermediary may be reopened by such intermediary on the motion of the provider affected by such determination,\" 42 CFR § 405.1885(a) (1997) (emphasis added). To be sure, the Secretary's Medicare Reimbursement Provider Manual §2931.2 (Feb. 1985) does provide that \"[w]hether or not the intermediary will reopen a determination, otherwise final, will depend upon whether (1) new and material evidence has been submitted, (2) a clear and obvious error was made, or (3) the determination is found to be inconsistent with the law, regulations and rulings, or general instructions.\" But we hardly think that this disjunctive listing of factors was meant to convert a discretionary function into a mandatory one. As to factor (1), for example, it seems to us inconceivable that the existence of new and material evidence would alone require reopening, no matter how unpersuasive that evidence might be. The present case, we might note, involves evidence that was already before the intermediary at the time of its decision. The holding of ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, supra, that the decision whether to reopen, at least where no new evidence is at issue, is \"committed to agency discretion by law\" within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, and hence unreviewable, see id., at 282, is squarely applicable.\n\n\n12\nThe last point alone would suffice to defeat petitioner's suggestion that we grant it the relief it requests under the judicial-review provision of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706. In addition, however, we have long held that this provision is not an independent grant of subject-matter jurisdiction. Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).\n\n\n13\n* * *\n\n\n14\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n15\nIt is so ordered.\n\nNotes\n\n16\n1.  The clause immediately following the quoted portion of the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual reads \"except for providers which are located within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where such a refusal to reopen is appealable.\" §2926, App. A, ¶B.4. This exception obviously reflects, not an inconsistency in the Secretary's position, but an acknowledgement of the Ninth Circuit's rejection of that position. See Oregon v. Bowen, 854 F.2d 346 (1988).\n\n\n17\n2.  The relevant portion of §205(g), as set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) (1970 ed.), provided that \"[a]ny individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days   .\" See Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S., at 108.\n\n\n18\n3.  The Secretary urges us to hold that mandamus is altogether unavailable to review claims arising under the Medicare Act, in light of the second sentence of 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), which provides that \"[n]o findings of fact or decision of the [Secretary] shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as\" provided in the Medicare Act itself. We have avoided deciding this issue in the past, see, e.g., Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 616 17 (1984), and we again find it unnecessary to reach it today.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

See 21 U.S. C. §846.\nThe District Court calculated Nelson’s sentencing range\nunder the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and im\nposed a sentence of 360 months in prison (the bottom of\nthe range). During sentencing, the judge explained that\nunder Fourth Circuit precedent, “ ‘the Guidelines are\nconsidered presumptively reasonable,’ ” so that “ ‘unless\nthere’s a good reason in the [statutory sentencing] fac\ntors . . . , the Guideline sentence is the reasonable sen\ntence.’ ” Pet. for Cert. 10.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit affirmed Nelson’s conviction and sentence. United\nStates v. Nelson, 237 Fed. Appx. 819 (2007) (per curiam).\nIt noted that within-Guidelines sentences are presump\ntively reasonable, and rejected Nelson’s argument that the\nDistrict Court’s reliance on that presumption was error.\nId., at 821.\n   Nelson filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. We\ngranted the petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded\nthe case to the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in\nlight of Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338 (2007). Nelson\nv.

The court acknowledged that under\n2                NELSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nRita, while courts of appeals “may apply a presumption of\nreasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a\nproper application of the Sentencing Guidelines,” 551\nU.S., at 347, “the sentencing court does not enjoy the\nbenefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sen\ntence should apply,” id., at 351. Instead, the sentencing\ncourt must first calculate the Guidelines range, and then\nconsider what sentence is appropriate for the individual\ndefendant in light of the statutory sentencing factors, 18\nU.S. C. §3553(a), explaining any variance from the former\nwith reference to the latter. Nonetheless, the Fourth\nCircuit upheld the sentence, finding that the District\nCourt did not treat the Guidelines as “mandatory” but\nrather understood that they were only advisory. 276 Fed.\nAppx., at 333.\n  Nelson has again filed a petition for a writ of certiorari,\nreasserting, inter alia, essentially the same argument he\nmade before us the first time: that the District Court’s\nstatements clearly indicate that it impermissibly applied a\npresumption of reasonableness to his Guidelines range.\nThe United States admits that the Fourth Circuit erred in\nrejecting that argument following our remand; we agree.\n  Our cases do not allow a sentencing court to presume\nthat a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range is\nreasonable. In Rita we said as much, in fairly explicit\nterms: “We repeat that the presumption before us is an\nappellate court presumption. . . . [T]he sentencing court\ndoes not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the\nGuidelines sentence should apply.” 551 U.S., at 351. And\nin Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), we reiter\nated that district judges, in considering how the various\nstatutory sentencing factors apply to an individual defen\ndant, “may not presume that the Guidelines range is\nreasonable.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11–12).\n  In this case, the Court of Appeals quoted the above\nlanguage from Rita but affirmed the sentence anyway\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

The Guidelines are not only not mandatory on\nsentencing courts; they are also not to be presumed rea\nsonable. We think it plain from the comments of the\nsentencing judge that he did apply a presumption of rea\nsonableness to Nelson’s Guidelines range.

In the following year Ohio prison officials told respondent they planned to revoke his parole status.

He was arrested in October 1994, and later that year sought a writ of habeas corpus from the New Mexico State District Court.  He claimed he was not a \"fugitive'' for purposes of extradition because he fled under duress, believing that Ohio authorities intended to revoke his parole without due process and to cause him physical harm if he were returned to an Ohio prison.  In January 1995, the New Mexico trial court ruled in favor of respondent and directed his release from custody.  The State appealed this order, and in September 1997 the Supreme Court of New Mexico affirmed the grant of habeas corpus. 124 N.M. 129, 947 P.2d 86 (1997).

Doran, 439 U.S. 282, 99 S.Ct. 530, 58 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978), we said:\n\n\n7\n\"Once the Governor has granted extradition, a court      considering release on habeas corpus can do no more than      decide (a) whether the extradition documents on their face      are in order; (b) whether the petitioner has been charged      with a crime in the demanding state; (c) whether the      petitioner is the person named in the request for      extradition; and (d) whether the petitioner is a fugitive.      These are historic facts readily verifiable.'' Id., at 289,      99 S.Ct., at 535.\n\n\n8\nThe Supreme Court of New Mexico agreed that the first three requirements had been met, but decided that respondent was not a \"fugitive'' from justice; in the words of the Supreme Court of New Mexico, he was a \"refugee from injustice.'' 124 N.M., at 146, 947 P.2d, at 103.  That court held that respondent fled Ohio because of fear that his parole would be revoked without due process, and that he would be thereafter returned to prison where he faced the threat of bodily injury.  This \"duress'' negated his status as a fugitive under Article IV.\n\n\n9\nThese are serious charges, unrebutted by any evidence at the hearing in the state trial court.  It may be noted, however, that the State of Ohio was not a party at that hearing, and the State of New Mexico which was defending the Governor's action is at a considerable disadvantage in producing testimony, even in affidavit form, of occurrences in the State of Ohio.  Very likely Ohio was aware of our statement in Sweeney v. Woodall, 344 U.S. 86, 89-90, 73 S.Ct. 139, 140-141, 97 L.Ed. 114 (1952), that the \"scheme of interstate rendition, as set forth in both the Constitution and the statutes which Congress has enacted to implement the Constitution,  . . .  do[es] not contemplate an appearance by [the demanding state] in respondent's asylum to defend against the claimed abuses of its prison system.''\n\n\n10\nWe accept, of course, the determination of the Supreme Court of New Mexico that respondent's testimony was credible, but this is simply not the kind of issue that may be tried in the asylum State.  In case after case we have held that claims relating to what actually happened in the demanding State, the law of the demanding State, and what may be expected to happen in the demanding State when the fugitive returns, are issues that must be tried in the courts of that State, and not in those of the asylum State. Drew v. Thaw, 235 U.S. 432, 35 S.Ct. 137, 59 L.Ed.  302 (1914); Sweeney v. Woodall, 344 U.S. 86, 73 S.Ct. 139, 97 L.Ed. 114 (1952); Michigan v. Doran, supra, Pacileo v. Walker, 449 U.S. 86, 101 S.Ct. 308, 66 L.Ed.2d 304 (1980).  As we said in Pacileo:\n\n\n11\n\"Once the Governor of California issued the warrant for      arrest and rendition in response to the request of the      Governor of Arkansas, claims as to constitutional defects in      the Arkansas penal system should be heard in the courts of      Arkansas, not those of California. \"To allow plenary review      in the asylum state of issues that can be fully litigated in      the charging state would defeat the plain purposes of the      summary and mandatory procedures authorized by Article IV,      §2.' Michigan v. Doran, supra, at 290 [99 S.Ct., at 536].''      Id., at 88, 101 S.Ct., at 309.\n\n\n12\nThere are practical reasons as well as legal reasons which support this result.  In a brief filed by 40 States as amici curiae, we are advised that in 1997, for example, Ohio made 218 extradition requests from its sister States, and returned 209 prisoners to other States.  California in that same year had a total of 685 demands and returns, New York 490, Texas 700, and Pennsylvania 543.* The burden on a demanding State of producing witnesses and records in the asylum State to counter allegations such as those of respondent's in this case would be substantial, indeed.\n\n\n13\nThe Supreme Court of New Mexico also held that the New Mexico Constitution's provision guaranteeing the right \"of seeking and obtaining safety'' prevailed over the State's duty under Article IV of the United States Constitution.  But as long  ago as Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 16 L.Ed. 717 (1860), we  held that the duty imposed by the Extradition Clause on the asylum State was mandatory.  In Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U.S. 219, 227, 107 S.Ct. 2802, 2808, 97 L.Ed.2d 187 (1987), we reaffirmed \"the conclusion that the commands of the Extradition Clause are mandatory, and afford no discretion to the executive officers or the courts of the asylum State.''  And in California  v. Superior Court of Cal., San Bernardino Cty., 482 U.S. 400, 405-406, 107 S.Ct. 2433, 2437, 96 L.Ed.2d 332 (1987), we said:\n\n\n14\n\"The Federal Constitution places certain limits on the      sovereign powers of the States, limits that are an essential      part of the Framers' conception of national identity and      Union.  One such limit is found in Article IV, §2, cl. 2, the      Extradition Clause: [text of clause omitted].\n\n\n15\n\"The obvious objective of the Extradition Clause is that no      State should become a safe haven for the fugitives from a      sister State's criminal justice system.''\n\n\n16\nAs is apparent from the length of time this proceeding has taken in the courts of New Mexico, it has been anything but the \"summary'' proceeding contemplated by the decisions cited above. This is because the Supreme Court of New Mexico went beyond the permissible inquiry in an extradition case, and permitted the litigation of issues not open in the asylum State.  The State's petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the New Mexico Supreme Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n17\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The motion of National Association of Extradition Officials for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae is granted.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

When a school district falls short of Chapter 39's accreditation criteria, the State Commissioner of Education may select from 10 possible sanctions, including appointment of a master to oversee the district's operations, Tex. Educ.Code Ann. §39.131(a)(7), or appointment of a management team to direct operations in areas of unacceptable performance or to require contracting out of services, §39.131(a)(8).  Texas, a covered jurisdiction under §5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, submitted Chapter 39 to the United States Attorney General for a determination whether any of the sanctions affected voting and thus required preclearance. While the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights did not object to §§39.131(a)(7) and (8), he cautioned that under certain circumstances their implementation might result in a §5 violation. Texas subsequently filed a complaint in the District  Court, seeking a declaration that §5 does not apply to the §§39.131(a)(7) and (8) sanctions.  The court did not reach the merits of the case because it concluded that Texas's claim was not ripe.\nHeld: Texas's claim is not ripe for adjudication.  A claim resting upon \"\"contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all,''' is not fit for adjudication. Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.,  473 U.S. 568, 581, 105 S.Ct. 3325, 3333, 87 L.Ed.2d 409.  Whether the problem Texas presents will ever need solving is too speculative.  Texas will appoint a master or management team only after a school district falls below state standards and the Commissioner has tried other, less intrusive sanctions.  Texas has not pointed to any school district in which the application of §39.131(a)(7) or (8) is currently foreseen or even likely.  Even if there were greater certainty regarding implementation, the claim would not be ripe because the legal issues Texas raises are not yet fit for judicial decision and because the hardship to Texas of withholding court consideration until the State chooses to implement one of the sanctions is insubstantial.  See Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515-1516, 18 L.Ed.2d 681. Pp. ____-____.\nAffirmed.\nSCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nJavier Aguilar, Austin, TX, for appellant.\nPaul R.Q. Wolfson, Washington, DC, for appellees.\nJustice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAppellant, the State of Texas, appeals from the judgment of a three-judge district court for the District of Columbia.  The State had sought a declaratory judgment that the preclearance provisions of §5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §1973c, do not apply to implementation of certain sections of the Texas Education Code that permit the State to sanction local school districts for failure to meet state-mandated educational achievement levels.  This appeal presents the question whether the controversy is ripe.\n\n\n2\n* In Texas, both the state government and local school districts are responsible for the public schools.  There are more than 1,000 school districts, each run by an elected school board. In 1995, the Texas Legislature enacted a comprehensive scheme (Chapter 39) that holds local school boards accountable to the State for student achievement.  Tex. Educ.Code Ann. §§39.021-39.131 (1996).  Chapter 39 contains detailed prescriptions for assessment of student academic skills, development of academic performance indicators, determination of accreditation status for school districts, and imposition of accreditation sanctions.  It  seeks to measure the academic performance of Texas schoolchildren, to reward the schools and school districts that achieve the legislative goals, and to sanction those that fall short.\n\n\n3\nWhen a district fails to satisfy the State's accreditation criteria, the State Commissioner of Education may select from 10 possible sanctions that are listed in ascending order of severity. §§39.131(a)(1)-(10).  Those include, \"to the extent the [C]ommissioner determines necessary,'' §39.131(a), appointing a master to oversee the district's operations, §39.131(a)(7), or appointing a management team to direct the district's operations in areas of unacceptable performance or to require the district to contract for services from another person, §39.131(a)(8).  When the Commissioner appoints masters or management teams, he \"shall clearly define the[ir] powers and duties'' and shall review the need for them every 90 days. §39.131(e).  A master or  management team may approve or disapprove any action taken by a school principal, the district superintendent, or the district's  board of trustees, and may also direct them to act. §§39.131(e)(1), (2). State law prohibits masters or management teams from taking any action concerning a district election, changing the number of members on or the method of selecting the  board of trustees, setting a tax rate for the district, or adopting a budget which establishes a different level of spending for the district from that set by the board. §§39.131(e)(3)-(6).\n\n\n4\nTexas is a covered jurisdiction under §5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, see 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (1997), and consequently, before it can implement changes affecting voting it must obtain preclearance from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or from the Attorney General of the United States. 42 U.S.C. §1973c.  Texas submitted Chapter 39 to the Attorney General for administrative preclearance.  The Assistant Attorney General* requested further information, including the criteria used to select special masters and management teams, a detailed description of their powers and duties, and the difference between their duties and those of the elected boards.  The State responded by pointing out the limits placed on masters and management teams in §39.131(e), and by noting that the actual authority granted \"is set by the Commissioner at the time of appointment depending on the needs of the district.''  App. to Juris. Statement 99a.  After receiving this information, the Assistant Attorney General concluded that the first six sanctions do not affect voting and therefore do not require preclearance.  He did not object to §§39.131(a)(7) and (8), insofar as the provisions are \"enabling in nature,'' but he cautioned that \"under certain foreseeable circumstances their implementation may result in a violation of Section 5'' which would require preclearance. Id., at 36a.\n\n\n5\nOn June 7, 1996, Texas filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a declaration that §5 does not apply to the sanctions authorized by §§39.131(a)(7) and (8), because (1) they are not changes with respect to voting, and (2) they are consistent with conditions attached to grants of federal financial assistance that authorize and require the imposition of sanctions to insure accountability of local education authorities.  The District Court did not reach the merits of these arguments because it concluded that Texas's claim was not ripe.  We noted probable jurisdiction. 521 U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 29, 138 L.Ed.2d 1059 (1997).\n\nII\n\n6\nA claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon \"\"contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.''' Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U.S. 568, 581, 105 S.Ct. 3325, 3333, 87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985) (quoting 13A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3532, p. 112 (1984)).  Whether Texas will appoint a master or management team under §§39.131(a)(7) and (8) is contingent on a number of factors.  First, a school district must fall below the state standards.  Then, pursuant to state policy,  the Commissioner must try first \"the imposition of sanctions which do not include the appointment of a master or management team,'' App. 10 (Original Complaint ¶12).  He may, for example, \"order the preparation of a student achievement improvement plan . . . , submission of the plan to the [C]ommissioner for approval, and implementation of the plan,'' §39.131(a)(3), or \"appoint an agency monitor to participate in and report to the agency on the activities of the board of trustees or the superintendent,'' §39.131(a)(6).  It is only if these less intrusive options fail that a Commissioner may appoint a master or management team, Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, and even then, only \"to  the extent the [C]ommissioner determines necessary,'' §39.131(a).  Texas has not pointed to any particular school district in which  the application of §§39.131(a)(7) or (8) is currently foreseen or even likely.  Indeed, Texas hopes that there will be no need to appoint a master or management team for any district.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-17.  Under these circumstances, where \"we have no idea whether or when such [a sanction] will be ordered,'' the issue is not fit for adjudication. Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 158, 163, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 1524, 18 L.Ed.2d 697 (1967); see also Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 321-322, 111 S.Ct. 2331, 2338-2339, 115 L.Ed.2d 288 (1991).\n\n\n7\nEven if there were greater certainty regarding ultimate implementation of paragraphs (a)(7) and (a)(8) of the statute, we do not think Texas's claim would be ripe.  Ripeness \"requir[es] us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.'' Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967).  As to fitness of the issues: Texas asks us to hold that under no circumstances  can the imposition of these sanctions constitute a change affecting voting.  We do not have sufficient confidence in our powers of imagination to affirm such a negative.  The operation of the statute is better grasped when viewed in light of a particular application.  Here, as is often true, \" [d]etermination of the scope  . . .  of legislation in advance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.'' Longshoremen v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222, 224, 74 S.Ct. 447, 448, 98 L.Ed. 650 (1954).  In the present case, the remoteness and abstraction are increased by the fact that Chapter 39 has yet to be interpreted by the Texas courts.  Thus, \" [p]ostponing consideration of the questions presented, until a more concrete controversy arises, also has the advantage of permitting the state courts further opportunity to construe'' the provisions. Renne, 501 U.S., at 323, 111 S.Ct., at 2339-2340.\n\n\n8\nAnd as for hardship to the parties: This is not a case like Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 152, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1517, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967), where the regulation at issue had a \"direct effect on the day-to-day business'' of the plaintiffs, because they were compelled to affix required labelling to their products under threat of criminal sanction.  Texas is not required to engage in, or to refrain from, any conduct, unless and until it chooses to implement one of the noncleared remedies.  To be sure, if that contingency should arise compliance with the preclearance procedure could delay much needed action. (Prior to this litigation, Texas sought preclearance for the appointment of a master in a Dallas County school district, and despite a request for expedition the Attorney General took 90 days to give approval.  See Brief for Petitioner 37, n. 28.)  But even that inconvenience is avoidable.  If Texas is confident that the imposition of a master or management team does not constitute a change affecting voting, it should simply go ahead with the appointment.  Should the Attorney General or a private individual bring suit (and if the matter is as clear, even at this distance, as Texas thinks it is), we have no reason to doubt that a district court will deny a preliminary injunction.  See Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, 502 U.S. 491, 506, 112 S.Ct. 820, 830, 117 L.Ed.2d 51 (1992); City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U.S. 125, 129, n. 3, 103 S.Ct. 998, 1001, n. 3, 74 L.Ed.2d 863 (1983).  Texas claims that it suffers the immediate hardship of a \"threat to federalism.''  But that is an abstraction-and an abstraction no graver than the \"threat to personal freedom'' that exists whenever an agency regulation is promulgated, which we hold inadequate to support suit unless the person's primary conduct is affected.  Cf. Toilet Goods Assn., 387 U.S., at 164, 87 S.Ct., at 1524-1525.\n\n\n9\nIn sum, we find it too speculative whether the problem Texas presents will ever need solving; we find the legal issues Texas raises not yet fit for our consideration, and the hardship to Texas of biding its time insubstantial.  Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that this matter is not ripe for adjudication.\n\n\n10\nThe judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n\n11\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

On appeal, the Montana Supreme Court, in the decision before us, vacated the revocation order and remanded the case for resentencing.  249 Mont. 82, 813 P.2d 979 (1991).  The trial court subsequently resentenced respondent, again to a 5-year term of imprisonment, and the Montana Supreme Court upheld that sentence in a judgment not now before us for review.\n\n\n4\nThus, no matter which party might prevail in this Court, the respondent's term of imprisonment will be the same.  At oral argument, neither counsel identified any way in which the interests of his client would be advanced by a favorable decision on the merits—except, of course, for the potential benefit that might flow from an advisory opinion.1  Because it is not the business of this Court to render such opinions, it wisely decides to dismiss a petition that should not have been granted in the first place.\n\n\n5\nJustice WHITE, dissenting.\n\n\n6\nWe granted certiorari to consider whether the Fifth Amendment bars a State from conditioning probation upon the probationer's successful completion of a therapy program in which he would be required to admit responsibility for his criminal acts.  In the decision below, the Montana Supreme Court held that, \"absent any grant of immunity\" from prosecution for incriminating statements made during therapy, the Fifth Amendment \"prohibit[s] augmenting a defendant's sentence because he refuses to confess to a crime or invokes his privilege against self-incrimination.\"  249 Mont. 82, 91, 813 P.2d 979, 985 (1991).  The constitutional question is an important one and the decision below places the Montana Supreme Court in conflict with other courts.  See State v. Gleason, 154 Vt. 205, 576 A.2d 1246 (1990);  Henderson v. State, 543 So.2d 344 (Fla.App.1989);  Russell v. Eaves, 722 F.Supp. 558 (ED Mo.1989), appeal dismissed, 902 F.2d 1574 (CA8 1990).  I believe we should decide the question and resolve the conflict.\n\n\n7\nAs an initial matter, there can be no doubt that the decision below is a \"final judgment\" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1257. Although the Montana Supreme Court remanded the case for resentencing, this is clearly a case in which \"the federal issue, finally decided by the highest court in the State, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings.\"  Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 480, 95 S.Ct. 1029, 1038, 43 L.Ed.2d 328 (1975);  see also Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 85, n. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1195, n. 1, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\n\n\n8\nAt oral argument, however, two further questions were raised concerning whether any live controversy persists in this case. First, counsel for respondent stated that his client had been assured by state corrections officials that he would be paroled in the very near future.  If this were true, the outcome of this case could have no practical effect upon respondent's sentence. Second, counsel for petitioner stated his belief that a probationer would enjoy immunity from prosecution for incriminating statements made during court-ordered therapy.  This statement calls into doubt a critical assumption underpinning the Montana Supreme Court's judgment and might suggest that there really is no disagreement about the Fifth Amendment's application to this case.\n\n\n9\nIn my view, however, neither party's representation is sufficient to deprive this case of its status as a case or controversy.  First, as counsel for both parties readily acknowledged, there is nothing in the record to support the expectation of respondent's counsel that respondent will be paroled shortly without regard to his completion of the State's therapy program.  As far as the record is concerned, a decision in this case would affect respondent's eligibility for parole and thus have real consequences for the litigants.\n\n\n10\nNor does the State's \"concession\" that a defendant would have immunity from prosecution based upon incriminating statements made to a therapist moot this case or otherwise render it unsuitable for review.  This \"concession\" appeared to rest solely on the State's assumption that this Court's decision in Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984), mandated such a result.  That reading of Murphy, however, is at least debatable.  Because the State's concession appears to reflect a possible misunderstanding of its obligations under the law rather than any unequivocal and unconditional declaration of its own future prosecutorial policy, this statement does not moot this case or obviate the controversy.  If its reading of Murphy were shown to be erroneous, the State might well revert to the view that a defendant could be prosecuted on the basis of statements made during postconviction therapy.  Such a qualified concession is too uncertain a basis to find that no live controversy is presented.  Cf. United States v. Generix Drug Corp., 460 U.S. 453, 456, n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 1298, 1300, n. 6, 75 L.Ed.2d 198 (1983);  United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc., 393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S.Ct. 361, 364, 21 L.Ed.2d 344 (1968).  In any event, the Montana Supreme Court evidently was of the view that no grant of immunity protected respondent or others in his position and the State continues to suffer the consequences of its constitutional holding.\n\n\n11\nBecause I believe that a genuine and important controversy is presented in this case, I respectfully dissent from the dismissal of the writ of certiorari.\n\n\n\n1\n Indeed, counsel for the State went so far as to explain that a victory for Montana on the merits would actually work to the advantage of respondent, by subjecting him to treatment leading to parole eligibility:\n\"Question:  So you're really trying to advance his [respondent's] interests?\n\"[Answer]:  Yes, sir, we are.\n\"Question:  He is better off if you win than if you lose.\n\"[Answer]:  In our judgment that is certainly the case.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

At trial, over petitioner's objection, the court excused for cause five jurors who expressed reservations about the death penalty.  The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed, citing Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985), as ''controlling authority'' for a rule that appellate courts must defer to trial courts' findings concerning juror bias. Greene v. State, 266 Ga. 439, 440-442, 469 S.E.2d 129, 134-135 (1996).\n\n\n2\nWainwright v. Witt, supra, delineated the standard under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments for determining when a juror  may be excused for cause because of his views on the death penalty: whether these views would '' 'prevent or substantially  impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.' ''  Id., at 424, 105 S.Ct.,  at 852. Addressing petitioner's federal constitutional challenge to the juror disqualifications in this case, the Georgia Supreme  Court correctly recognized that Witt is, ''the controlling authority as to the death qualification of prospective jurors . . . . '' Greene, 266 Ga., at 440, 469 S.E.2d, at 134.*\n\n\n3\nWitt also held that, under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), federal courts must accord  a presumption of correctness to state courts' findings of juror bias. Wainwright, supra, at 426-430, 105 S.Ct., at 853-855.  The Supreme Court of Georgia said that Witt was also ''controlling authority'' on this point, and it therefore ruled that ''[t]he conclusion that a prospective juror is disqualified for bias is one that is based upon findings of demeanor and credibility which are peculiarly within the trial court's province and such findings are to be given deference by appellate courts. Wainwright v. Witt, [469 U.S.,] at 428 [105 S.Ct., at 854].'' Greene, supra, at 441, 469 S.E.2d 129.\n\n\n4\nWitt is not ''controlling authority'' as to the standard of review to be applied by state appellate courts reviewing trial courts' rulings on jury selection. Witt was a case arising on federal habeas, where deference to state court findings is mandated by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).  But this statute does not govern the standard of review of trial court findings by the Supreme Court of Georgia.  There is no indication in that court's opinion that it viewed Witt as merely persuasive authority, or that the court intended to borrow or adopt the Witt standard of review for its own purposes.  It believed itself bound by Witt's standard of review of trial court findings on jury-selection questions, and in so doing it was mistaken.\n\n\n5\nIn a similar case involving a state court's mistaken view that the First Amendment required it to reach a particular result, we said ''[w]e conclude that although the State of Ohio may as a matter of its own law privilege the press in the circumstances of this case, the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not require it to do so.''  Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562, 578-579, 97 S.Ct. 2849, 2859, 53  L.Ed.2d 965 (1977).  Here, too, the Supreme Court of Georgia is free to adopt the rule laid down in Witt for review of trial court findings in jury-selection cases, but it need not do so.  The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are therefore granted, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n6\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n We express no opinion as to the correctness of the Supreme Court of Georgia's application of the Witt standard in this case.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

The State's theory, insofar as is relevant here, was that Roy, coming to the aid of a confederate who was trying to rob Mannix, helped  the confederate kill Mannix.  The trial judge gave the jury an instruction that permitted it to convict Roy of first-degree murder as long as it concluded that (among other things) Roy, ''with knowledge of'' the confederate's ''unlawful purpose'' (robbery), had helped the confederate, i.e., had ''aid[ed],'' ''promote[d],'' ''encourage[d],'' or ''instigate[d]'' by ''act or advice the commission of'' the confederate's crime.  The California Supreme Court later held in People v. Beeman, 35 Cal.3d 547, 561, 199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 68-69, 674 P.2d 1318, 1326 (1984), that an identical instruction was erroneous because of what it did not say, namely that state law also required the jury to find that Roy had the ''knowledge [and] intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating'' the confederate's crime. Id., at 561, 199 Cal.Rptr., at 68-69, 674 P.2d, at 1326 (emphasis added). Despite this error, the California Court of Appeal affirmed Roy's conviction because it found the error ''harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.''  See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).  The California Supreme Court denied post-conviction relief.\n\n\n2\nSubsequently Roy, pointing to the same instructional error, asked a Federal District Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus. The District Court denied the request because, in its view, the error was harmless.  Indeed, the District Court wrote that no rational juror could have found that Roy knew the confederate's purpose and helped him but also found that Roy did not intend to help him.  A divided Ninth Circuit panel affirmed. Roy v. Gomez, 55 F.3d 1483 (1995).\n\n\n3\nThe Ninth Circuit later heard the case en banc and reversed the district court.  It held that the instructional error was not harmless.  81 F.3d 863 (1996).  In doing so, the majority applied a special ''harmless error'' standard, which it believed combined aspects of our decisions in Carella v. California, 491 U.S. 263, 109 S.Ct. 2419, 105 L.Ed.2d 218 (1989), and O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995).  The Ninth Circuit described the standard as follows:\n\n\n4\n''[T]he omission is harmless only if review of the facts      found by the jury establishes that the jury necessarily found      the omitted element.''  81 F.3d, at 867 (emphasis in      original).\n\n\n5\nAs we understand that statement in context, it meant\n\n\n6\n''[T]he omission [of the ''intent'' part of the instruction]      is harmless only if review of the facts found by the jury      [namely, assistance and knowledge] established that the jury      necessarily found the omitted element [namely,      ''intent''].''  Ibid.\n\n\n7\nThe State of California, seeking certiorari, argues that this definition of ''harmless error'' is far too strict and that  this Court's decisions require application of a significantly less strict ''harmless error'' standard in cases on collateral review. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710,  123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); O'Neal, supra.\n\n\n8\nWe believe that the State, and the dissenting judges in the Ninth Circuit, are correct about the proper standard.  The Ninth Circuit majority drew its special standard primarily from a concurring opinion in Carella, supra, a case that dealt with legal presumptions.  The concurrence in that case set out the views of several Justices about the proper way to determine whether an error in respect to the use of a presumption was ''harmless.'' Subsequent to Carella, however, this Court held that a federal court reviewing a state court de termination in a  habeas corpus proceeding, ordinarily should apply the ''harmless  error'' standard that the Court had previously enunciated in Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), namely ''whether the error 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' '' Brecht, supra, at 637, 113 S.Ct., at 1722 (citing Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).  The Court recognized that the Kotteakos standard did not apply to '' 'structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by ''harmless-error'' standards,' '' 507 U.S., at 629, 113 S.Ct., at 1717, but held that the Kotteakos standard did apply to habeas review of what the Court called ''trial errors,'' including errors in respect to which the Constitution requires state courts to apply a stricter, Chapman -type standard of ''harmless error'' when they review a conviction directly.  507 U.S., at 638, 113 S.Ct., at 1722.  In O'Neal, supra, this Court added that where a judge, in a habeas proceeding, applying this standard of harmless error, ''is in grave doubt as to the harmlessness of an error,'' the habeas ''petitioner must win.''  Id., at ----, 115 S.Ct., at 995.\n\n\n9\nThe case before us is a case for application of the ''harmless error'' standard as enunciated in Brecht and O'Neal. This Court has written that ''constitutional error'' of the sort at issue in Carella is a ''trial error,'' not a ''structural error,'' and that it is subject to ''harmless error'' analysis. Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 306-307, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1262-64, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991).  The state courts in this case applied harmless-error analysis of the strict variety, and they found the error ''harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.''  Chapman, supra, at 24, 87 S.Ct., at 828.  The specific error at issue here-an error in the instruction that defined the crime-is, as the Ninth Circuit itself recognized, as easily characterized as a ''misdescription of an element'' of the crime, as it is characterized as an error of ''omission.''  81 F.3d, at 867, n. 4. No one claims that the error at issue here is of the ''structural'' sort that '' 'def[ies] analysis by ''harmless error'' standards.' '' Brecht, supra, at 629, 113 S.Ct., at 1717. The analysis advanced by the Ninth Circuit, while certainly consistent with the concurring opinion in Carella, does not, in our view, overcome the holding of Brecht, followed in O'Neal, that for reasons related to the special function of habeas courts, those courts must review such error (error that may require strict review of the Chapman -type on direct appeal) under the Kotteakos standard.  Thus, we are convinced that the ''harmless error'' standards enunciated in Brecht and O'Neal should apply to the ''trial error'' before us as enunciated in those opinions and without the Ninth Circuit's modification.\n\n\n10\nFor these reasons, we grant respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the Ninth Circuit's determination, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n11\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n12\nJustice SCALIA, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins as to Part I, concurring.\n\n\n13\n* I agree with what the Court decides in its per curiam opinion:  that the Brecht-O'Neal standard for reversal of the conviction (''grave doubt as to the harmlessness of the error'') rather than the more stringent Chapman standard (inability to find the error ''harmless beyond a reasonable doubt'') applies to the error in this case when it is presented, not on direct appeal, but as grounds for habeas corpus relief.  The Ninth Circuit did not apply that more deferential standard, and I therefore concur in the remand.\n\n\n14\nI do not understand the opinion, however, to address the question of what constitutes the harmlessness to which this more deferen tial standard is applied-and on that point the Ninth Circuit was quite correct.  As we held in Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993), a criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to a jury verdict that he is guilty of the crime, and absent such a verdict the conviction must be reversed, ''no matter how inescapable the findings to support that verdict might be.''  Id., at 279, 113 S.Ct., at 2082. A jury verdict that he is guilty of the crime means, of course, a verdict that he is guilty of each necessary element of  the crime. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 2319-20, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995).  Formally, at least, such a verdict did not exist here:  the jury was never asked to determine that Roy had the ''intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating'' his confederate's crime. People v. Beeman, 35 Cal.3d 547, 561, 199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 68-69, 674 P.2d 1318, 1326 (1984).\n\n\n15\nThe absence of a formal verdict on this point can not be rendered harmless by the fact that, given the evidence, no reasonable jury would have found otherwise.  To allow the error to be cured in that fashion would be to dispense with trial by jury. ''The Sixth Amendment requires more than appellate speculation about a hypothetical jury's action, or else directed  verdicts for the State would be sustainable on appeal;  it requires an actual jury finding of guilty.''  Sullivan, supra, at 280, 113 S.Ct., at 2082.  The error in the present case can be harmless only if the jury verdict on other points effectively embraces this one or if it is impossible, upon the evidence, to have found what the verdict did find without finding this point as well.  See Carella v. California, 491 U.S. 263, 271, 109 S.Ct. 2419, 2423-24, 105 L.Ed.2d 218 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring).   I concur in the remand so that the Ninth Circuit may determine whether there is ''grave doubt'' that this is so, rather than (what it did) determine whether it is impossible to ''be certain'' that this is so, 81 F.3d 863, 867 (1996).  Elsewhere in its opinion, the Ninth Circuit purported to be applying the O'Neal standard, stating that ''[w]hen the reviewing court is unable to conclude the jury necessarily found an element that was omitted from the instructions,'' it ''can only be 'in grave doubt as to the harmlessness of the error,' '' 81 F.3d, at 868 (quoting O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 992, 994-95, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995)).  That seems to me to impart to the determination a black-and-white character which it does not possess, any more than other determinations possess it.  It can be ''the better view,'' but far from ''certain,'' that, given the facts in the record, no juror could find x without also finding y. What O'Neal means is that, when the point is arguable, the State's determination of harmless error must be sustained.\n\nII\n\n16\nOne final point:  I write as I have written only because the Court has rejected the traditional view of habeas corpus relief as discretionary.  See Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, 720, 113 S.Ct. 1745, 1768-69, 123 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  But for that precedent, I would be content to grant federal habeas relief for this sort of state-court error only when there has been no opportunity to litigate it before, or when there is substantial doubt, on the facts, whether the defendant was guilty.

DENNIS LEBLANC\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 16–1177. Decided June 12, 2017\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), a state prisoner is eligible for fed-\neral habeas relief if the underlying state court merits ruling\nwas “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law” as determined by this\nCourt. 28 U.S. C. §2254(d)(1). In this case, the Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit held that this demanding\nstandard was met by a Virginia court’s application of\nGraham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010). The question\npresented is whether the Court of Appeals erred in con-\ncluding that the state court’s ruling involved an unreason-\nable application of this Court’s holding.\n                              I\n   On July 6, 1999, respondent Dennis LeBlanc raped a 62-\nyear-old woman. He was 16 at the time. In 2003, a state\ntrial court sentenced him to life in prison for his crimes.\nIn the 1990’s, Virginia had, for felony offenders, abolished\nparole that followed a traditional framework. See Va.\nCode Ann. §53.1–165.1 (2013). As a form of replacement,\nVirginia enacted its so-called “geriatric release” program,\nwhich allows older inmates to receive conditional release\nunder some circumstances. LeBlanc v. Mathena, 841 F.3d\n256, 261 (CA4 2016) (citing Va. Code Ann. §53.1–40.01).\n   Seven years after respondent was sentenced, this Court\ndecided Graham v. Florida. Graham established that the\nEighth Amendment prohibits juvenile offenders convicted\nof nonhomicide offenses from being sentenced to life with-\n2                   VIRGINIA v. LEBLANC\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nout parole. While a “State is not required to guarantee\neventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a\nnonhomicide crime,” the Court held, it must “give defend-\nants like Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain\nrelease based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilita-\ntion.” 540 U.S., at 75. The Court in Graham left it to the\nStates, “in the first instance, to explore the means and\nmechanisms for compliance” with the Graham rule. Ibid.\n   Respondent later filed a motion in state trial court—the\nVirginia Beach Circuit Court—seeking to vacate his sen-\ntence in light of Graham. The trial court denied the mo-\ntion. In so doing, it relied on the Supreme Court of Virgin-\nia’s decision in Angel v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 248, 704\nS.E.2d 386 (2011). The Angel court held that Virginia’s\ngeriatric release program satisfies Graham’s requirement\nof parole for juvenile offenders. The statute establishing\nthe program provides:\n    “Any person serving a sentence imposed upon a con-\n    viction for a felony offense . . .

E. 2d, at\n402. The geriatric release program thus complied with\nGraham, the Angel court held, because it provided “the\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demon-\nstrated maturity and rehabilitation required by the Eighth\n                 Cite as: 582 U. S. ____ (2017)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nAmendment.” 281 Va., at 275, 704 S.E.2d, at 402 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n  The Virginia Supreme Court, in reviewing the trial\ncourt’s ruling in the instant case, summarily denied re-\nspondent’s requests for appeal and for rehearing.\n  In 2012, respondent filed a federal habeas petition in\nthe Eastern District of Virginia pursuant to 28 U.S. C.\n§2254. A Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing the\npetition, but the District Court disagreed and granted the\nwrit. The District Court explained that “there is no possi-\nbility that fairminded jurists could disagree that the state\ncourt’s decision conflicts wit[h] the dictates of Graham.”\nLeBlanc v. Mathena, 2015 WL 4042175, *18 (July 1, 2015).\n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit affirmed, holding that the state trial court’s ruling\nwas an unreasonable application of Graham. 841 F.3d, at\n259–260. In the panel majority’s view, Virginia’s geriatric\nrelease program did not provide a meaningful opportunity\nfor juvenile nonhomicide offenders to obtain release based\non demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\n  Judge Niemeyer dissented. He criticized the majority\nfor “fail[ing] to respect, in any meaningful way, the defer-\nence Congress requires federal courts to give state court\ndecisions on postconviction review.” Id., at 275.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia petitioned for certiorari.\nThe petition is now granted, and the judgment is reversed:\nThe Virginia trial court did not unreasonably apply the\nGraham rule.\n                              II\n  In order for a state court’s decision to be an unreason-\nable application of this Court’s case law, the ruling must be\n“objectively unreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear\nerror will not suffice.” Woods v. Donald, 575 U. S. ___, ___\n(2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In other words, a litigant must “show\n4                    VIRGINIA v. LEBLANC\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthat the state court’s ruling . . . was so lacking in justifica-\ntion that there was an error well understood and compre-\nhended in existing law beyond any possibility for fair-\nminded disagreement.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This is “meant to be” a difficult standard to\nmeet. Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 102 (2011).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred by\nfailing to accord the state court’s decision the deference\nowed under AEDPA. Graham did not decide that a geriat-\nric release program like Virginia’s failed to satisfy the\nEighth Amendment because that question was not pre-\nsented. And it was not objectively unreasonable for the\nstate court to conclude that, because the geriatric release\nprogram employed normal parole factors, it satisfied\nGraham’s requirement that juveniles convicted of a non-\nhomicide crime have a meaningful opportunity to receive\nparole. The geriatric release program instructs Virginia’s\nParole Board to consider factors like the “individual’s\nhistory . . . and the individual’s conduct . . . during incar-\nceration,” as well as the prisoner’s “inter-personal rela-\ntionships with staff and inmates” and “[c]hanges in atti-\ntude toward self and others.” See 841 F.3d, at 280–281\n(Niemeyer, J., dissenting) (citing Virginia Parole Board\nPolicy Manual 2–4 (Oct. 2006)). Consideration of these\nfactors could allow the Parole Board to order a former\njuvenile offender’s conditional release in light of his or her\n“demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” Graham, 560\nU.S., at 75. The state court thus did not diverge so far\nfrom Graham’s dictates as to make it “so obvious that . . .\nthere could be no ‘fairminded disagreement’ ” about\nwhether the state court’s ruling conflicts with this Court’s\ncase law.

The federalism\ninterest implicated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance\nin this case, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\ncuit’s holding created the potential for significant discord\nin the Virginia sentencing process.

Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to the charges, and the District Court sentenced him to the 10-year minimum sentence required by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) and the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG). The court refused Wade's request that his sentence be reduced below the minimum to reward him for his substantial assistance to the Government, holding that 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) and USSG § 5K1.1 empower the district courts to make such a reduction only if the Government files a motion requesting the departure.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Wade's arguments that the District Court erred in holding that the absence of a Government motion deprived it of the authority to reduce his sentence and that the lower court was authorized to enquire into the Government's motives for failing to file a motion.\n\nHeld:\n\n1. Federal district courts have the authority to review the Government's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.  Since the parties assume that the statutory and Guidelines provisions pose identical and equally burdensome obstacles, this Court is not required to decide whether § 5K1.1 \"implements\" and thereby supersedes § 3553(e) or whether the provisions pose separate obstacles.  In both provisions, the condition limiting the court's authority gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a substantial-assistance motion. Nonetheless, a prosecutor's discretion when exercising that power is subject to constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce.  Thus, a defendant would be entitled to relief if the prosecution refused to file a motion for a suspect reason such as the defendant's race or religion.  However, neither a claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance nor additional but generalized allegations of improper motive will entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing.  A defendant has a right to the latter procedures only if he makes a substantial threshold showing of improper motive.  Pp. 184-186.\n2. Wade has failed to raise a claim of improper motive.  He has never alleged or pointed to evidence tending to show that the Government refused to file a motion for suspect reasons.  And he argues to no avail that, because the District Court erroneously believed that no impermissible motive charge could state a claim for relief, it thwarted his attempt to show that the Government violated his constitutional rights by withholding the motion arbitrarily or in bad faith.  While Wade would be entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationally related to any legitimate Government end, the record here shows no support for his claim of frustration, and the claim as presented to the District Court failed to rise to the level warranting judicial enquiry.  In response to the court's invitation to state what evidence he would introduce to support his claim, Wade merely explained the extent of his assistance to the Government.  This is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for relief, because the Government's decision not to move may have been based simply on its rational assessment of the cost and benefit that would flow from moving.  Pp. 186-187.\n936 F.2d 169 (CA4 1991), affirmed.\nSOUTER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nJ. Matthew Martin, Hillsborough, N.C., for petitioner.\nRobert A. Long, Jr., Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nJustice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nSection 3553(e) of Title 18 of the United States Code empowers district courts, \"[u]pon motion of the Government,\" to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum to reflect a defendant's \"substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\" Similarly, § 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1991) (USSG), permits district courts to go below the minimum required under the Guidelines if the Government files a \"substantial assistance\" motion.  This case presents the question whether district courts may subject the Government's refusal to file such a motion to review for constitutional violations.  We hold that they may, but that the petitioner has raised no claim to such review.\n\n\n2\nOn October 30, 1989, police searched the house of the petitioner, Harold Ray Wade, Jr., discovered 978 grams of cocaine, two handguns and more than $22,000 in cash, and arrested Wade.  In the aftermath of the search, Wade gave law enforcement officials information that led them to arrest another drug dealer.  In due course, a federal grand jury indicted Wade for distributing cocaine and possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it, both in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1);  for conspiring to do these things, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846;  and for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).  Wade pleaded guilty to all four counts.\n\n\n3\nThe presentence report put the sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines for the drug offenses at 97-121 months, but added that Wade was subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B), narrowing the actual range to 120-121 months, see USSG § 5G1.1(c)(2).  The report also stated that both Guideline § 2K2.4(a) and 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) required a 5-year sentence on the gun count.  At the sentencing hearing in the District Court, Wade's lawyer urged the court to impose a sentence below the 10-year minimum for the drug counts to reward Wade for his assistance to the Government.  The court responded that the Government had filed no motion as contemplated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) and USSG § 5K1.1 for sentencing below the minimum, and ruled that, without such a motion, a court had no power to go beneath the minimum.  Wade got a sentence of 180 months in prison.\n\n\n4\nIn the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Wade argued the District Court was in error to say that the absence of a Government motion deprived it of authority to impose a sentence below 10 years for the drug convictions.  Wade lost this argument, 936 F.2d 169, 171 (1991), and failed as well on his back-up claim that the District Court was at least authorized to enquire into the Government's motives for filing no motion, the court saying that any such enquiry would intrude unduly upon a prosecutor's discretion, id., at 172.  We granted certiorari, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 635, 116 L.Ed.2d 653 (1991), and now affirm.\n\nThe full text of § 3553(e) is this:\n\n5\n\"Limited Authority to Impose a Sentence Below a Statutory      Minimum.—Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have      the authority to impose a sentence below a level established      by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's      substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of      another person who has committed an offense.  Such sentence      shall be imposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy      statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to      section 994 of title 28, United States Code.\"  18 U.S.C. §      3553(e).\n\n\n6\nAnd this is the relevant portion of § 5K1.1:\n\n\n7\n\"Substantial Assistance to Authorities (Policy Statement)\n\n\n8\n\"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has      provided substantial assistance in the investigation or      prosecution of another person who has committed an offense,      the court may depart from the guidelines.\"  USSG § 5K1.1.\n\n\n9\nBecause Wade violated federal criminal statutes that carry mandatory minimum sentences, this case implicates both 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) and USSG § 5K1.1.  Wade and the Government apparently assume that where, as here, the minimum under the Guidelines is the same as the statutory minimum and the Government has refused to file any motion at all, the two provisions pose identical and equally burdensome obstacles.  See Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 2;  Brief for United States 11, n. 2. We are not, therefore, called upon to decide whether § 5K1.1 \"implements\" and thereby supersedes § 3553(e), see United States v. Ah-Kai, 951 F.2d 490, 493-494 (CA2 1991);  United States v. Keene, 933 F.2d 711, 713-714 (CA9 1991), or whether the two provisions pose two separate obstacles, see United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, 958 F.2d 1441, 1443 (CA8 1992).\n\n\n10\nWade concedes, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that § 3553(e) imposes the condition of a Government motion upon the district court's authority to depart, Brief for Petitioner 9-10, and he does not argue otherwise with respect to § 5K1.1.  He does not claim that the Government-motion requirement is itself unconstitutional, or that the condition is superseded in this case by any agreement on the Government's behalf to file a substantial-assistance motion, cf.  Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262-263, 92 S.Ct. 495, 498-499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); United States v. Conner, 930 F.2d 1073, 1075-1077 (CA4), cert. denied, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 420, 116 L.Ed.2d 440 (1991). Wade's position is consistent with the view, which we think is clearly correct, that in both § 3553(e) and § 5K1.1 the condition limiting the court's authority gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\n\n\n11\nWade nonetheless argues, and again we agree, that a prosecutor's discretion when exercising that power is subject to constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce. Because we see no reason why courts should treat a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion differently from a prosecutor's other decisions, see, e.g., Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 608-609, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 1531-1532, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985), we hold that federal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.  Thus, a defendant would be entitled to relief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance motion, say, because of the defendant's race or religion.\n\n\n12\nIt follows that a claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing.  Nor would additional but generalized allegations of improper motive.  See, e.g., United States v. Redondo-Lemos, 955 F.2d 1296, 1302-1303 (CA9 1992); United States v. Jacob, 781 F.2d 643, 646-647 (CA8 1986);  United States v. Gallegos-Curiel, 681 F.2d 1164, 1169 (CA9 1982) (Kennedy, J.);  United States v. Berrios, 501 F.2d 1207, 1211 (CA2 1974).  Indeed, Wade concedes that a defendant has no right to discovery or an evidentiary hearing unless he makes a \"substantial threshold showing.\"  Brief for Petitioner 26.\n\n\n13\nWade has failed to make one.  He has never alleged, much less claimed to have evidence tending to show, that the Government refused to file a motion for suspect reasons such as his race or his religion.  Instead, Wade argues now that the District Court thwarted his attempt to make quite different allegations on the record because it erroneously believed that no charge of impermissible motive could state a claim for relief.  Hence, he now seeks an order of remand to allow him to develop a claim that the Government violated his constitutional rights by withholding a substantial-assistance motion \"arbitrarily\" or \"in bad faith.\" See Brief for Petitioner 25.  This, Wade says, the Government did by refusing to move because of \"factors that are not rationally related to any legitimate state objective,\" see Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, although he does not specifically identify any such factors.\n\n\n14\nAs the Government concedes, see Brief for United States 26 (citing New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2515-2516, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976) (per curiam )), Wade would be entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationally related to any legitimate Government end, cf. Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct. 1919, ---- - ----, 114 L.Ed.2d (1991), but his argument is still of no avail. This is so because the record shows no support for his claim of frustration in trying to plead an adequate claim, and because his claim as presented to the District Court failed to rise to the level warranting judicial enquiry.  The District Court expressly invited Wade's lawyer to state for the record what evidence he would introduce to support his position if the court were to conduct a hearing on the issue.  App. 10.  In response, his counsel merely explained the extent of Wade's assistance to the Government.  Ibid.  This, of course, was not enough, for although a showing of assistance is a necessary condition for relief, it is not a sufficient one.  The Government's decision not to move may have been based not on a failure to acknowledge or appreciate Wade's help, but simply on its rational assessment of the cost and benefit that would flow from moving.  Cf. United States v. Doe, 290 U.S.App.D.C. 65, 70, 934 F.2d 353, 358, cert. denied, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 268, 116 L.Ed.2d 221 (1991);  United States v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1016 (CA1 1990).\n\n\n15\nIt is clear, then, that, on the present record, Wade is entitled to no relief, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be\n\n\n16\n\nAffirmed.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

On retrial after the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed her conviction because of an error in the admission of evidence, the jury again convicted her.  Branch moved for a new trial, and the trial court scheduled a hearing for April 3, 1989, to consider this motion and to sentence her. Before the hearing, however, Branch, who was free on bail, took flight to a neighboring county.  She was recaptured on April 6, 1989, and sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole.\n\n\n3\nBranch filed a timely notice of appeal on direct review and an appeal of the trial court's denial of her motion for post-conviction relief.  In 1991, the Missouri Court of Appeals consolidated and dismissed the appeals under Missouri's well-established fugitive dismissal rule which provides that a defendant who attempts to escape justice after conviction forfeits her right to appeal.  State v. Branch, 811 S.W.2d 11, 12 (Mo.App.1991) (citing State v. Carter, 98 Mo. 431, 11 S.W. 979 (1889)).  \"[E]ven in the absence of prejudice to the state,\" the court explained, \"the dismissal was justified by a more fundamental principle:  preservation of public respect for our system of law.\"  811 S.W.2d at 12.  Branch did not seek review in this Court.\n\n\n4\nOn petition for federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, Branch alleged that the dismissal of her consolidated appeal violated due process.  The District Court undertook what it termed a procedural due process analysis under the framework set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), and denied relief.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 17, 22-24.  Branch appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, arguing she had stated a procedural due process violation.  For the first time, at oral argument, the Eighth Circuit panel suggested the claim was a substantive, not a procedural due process claim.  Id., at 137.  Branch's counsel, of course, welcomed the suggestion.  On that ground, a divided panel held that dismissal of an appeal where pre-appeal flight had no adverse effect on the appellate process violated the defendant's substantive rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  After the Eighth Circuit denied the State's motion for rehearing en banc, the majority modified its opinion to explain that it would not confront the applicability of Teague because the State had waived the point.  Branch v. Turner, 37 F.3d 371, 374-375 (1994).\n\n\n5\nThe application of Teague is a threshold question in a federal habeas case.  Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 114 S.Ct. 948, 952-953, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994).  Although a court need not entertain the defense if the State has not raised it, see Schiro v. Farley, 510 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 114 S.Ct. 783, 788-789, 127 L.Ed.2d 47 (1994);  Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, n. 8, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 2685, n. 8, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993), a court must apply it if it was raised by the State, Caspari, supra, 510 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 953.\n\n\n6\nThe State's Teague argument was preserved on this record and in the record before the Court of Appeals.  In the District Court, the State argued that respondent's due process claim \"is barred from litigation in federal habeas corpus unless the Court could say, as a threshold matter, that it would make its new rule of law retroactive.  Teague v. Lane.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 99 (citation omitted).  In its brief on appeal, the State pointed out that it had raised the Teague issue before the District Court, see Branch, supra, at 374, and argued that if the court were to decide that a constitutional rule prohibited dismissal, \"such a conclusion could not be enforced in this collateral-attack proceeding consistently with the principles set forth in Teague v. Lane, and its progeny,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 129, n. 5 (citation omitted).  Confronted for the first time at oral argument with a substantive due process claim, the State reasserted that \"the prohibition of Teague against Lane on the enforcement of new rules of constitutional law for the first time in a collateral attack proceeding in federal court applies with full force to this case.\" Id., at 152.  The next five pages of the record are devoted to the court's questions and the State's responses regarding the Teague issue.  Id., at 153-157.\n\n\n7\nThis record supports the State's position that it raised the Teague claim.  The State's efforts to alert the Eighth Circuit to the Teague problem provided that court with ample opportunity to make a reasoned jud gment on the issue.  Cf. Webb v. Webb, 451 U.S. 493, 501, 101 S.Ct. 1889, 1894, 68 L.Ed.2d 392 (1981) (federal claim properly raised where there is \"no doubt from the record that [the claim] was presented in the state courts and that those courts were apprised of the nature or substance of the federal claim\").  The State did not waive the Teague issue;  it must be considered now;  and it is dispositive.  See Caspari, supra, 510 U.S., at ---- - ----, 114 S.Ct., at 951-952;  Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 2112, 2115-2116, 124 L.Ed.2d 306  (1993).\n\n\n8\nA new rule for Teague purposes is one where \"the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final.\"  Caspari, supra, 510 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 953 (quoting Teague, 489 U.S., at 301, 109 S.Ct., at 1070) (emphasis deleted);  Gilmore, supra, at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2116;  Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 892, 897, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993).  The question is \" 'whether a state court considering [the defendant's] claim at the time his conviction became final would have felt compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule [he] seeks was required by the Constitution.' \"  Caspari, supra, 510 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 953 (quoting Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 488, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 1260, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990)).\n\n\n9\nNeither respondent nor the Eighth Circuit identifies existing precedent for the proposition that there is no substantial basis for appellate dismissal when a defendant fails to appear at sentencing, becomes a fugitive, demonstrates contempt for the legal system, and imposes significant cost and expense on the State to secure her recapture.  The Eighth Circuit opined that a substantive due process violation arose from conduct that was \"arbitrary,\" \"conscience-shocking,\" \"oppressive in a constitutional sense,\" or \"interferes with fundamental rights,\" and that dismissal of Branch's appeal fell within that category. Branch, supra, at 375.  These arguments are not based upon existing or well-settled authority.\n\n\n10\nRespondent and the Court of Appeals rely for the most part on Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1199, 1208, 122 L.Ed.2d 581 (1993).  There, the Court held, as a matter of its supervisory power to administer the federal court system, that absent some adverse effect of pre-appeal flight on the appellate process, \"the defendant's former fugitive status may well lack the kind of connection to the appellate process that would justify an appellate sanction of dismissal.\"  Id., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 1209.  The case was decided almost two years after Branch's conviction became final.  The rationale of the opinion, moreover, was limited to supervisory powers;  it did not suggest that dismissal of a fugitive's appeal implicated constitutional principles.  Nor was that suggestion made in any of our earlier cases discussing the fugitive dismissal rule in the federal or state courts.  See Estelle v. Dorrough, 420 U.S. 534, 95 S.Ct. 1173, 43 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975);  Molinaro v. New Jersey, 396 U.S. 365, 90 S.Ct. 498, 24 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970);  Allen v. Georgia, 166 U.S. 138, 17 S.Ct. 525, 41 L.Ed. 949 (1897);  Bohanan v. Nebraska, 125 U.S. 692, 8 S.Ct. 1390, 31 L.Ed. 854 (1887);  Smith v. United States, 94 U.S. 97, 24 L.Ed. 32 (1876).  The Ortega-Rodriguez dissent reinforced this point:  \"There can be no argument that the fugitive dismissal rule . . . violates the Constitution because a convicted criminal has no constitutional right to an appeal.\"  507 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 1210 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (citation omitted).\n\n\n11\nThe Eighth Circuit did rely on Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 105 S.Ct. 830, 83 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985), where the Court held that the Due Process Clause, guaranteeing a defendant effective assistance of counsel on his first appeal as of right, did not permit the dismissal of an appeal where the failure to comply with appellate procedure was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.  The Court did not hold, as respondent argues and the Eighth Circuit seemed to conclude, that due process requires state courts to provide for appellate review where the would-be appellant has not satisfied reasonable preconditions on her right to appeal as a result of her own conduct.  Evitts turned on the right to effective assistance of counsel;  it left intact \"the States' ability to conduct appeals in accordance with reasonable procedural rules.\"  Id., at 398-399, 105 S.Ct., at 837.\n\n\n12\nBranch argues that even if Teague does apply, the rule announced by the Eighth Circuit falls into Teague's exception for \" 'watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" Saffle v. Parks, supra, 494 U.S., at 495, 110 S.Ct., at 1264 (citing Teague, supra, 489 U.S., at 311, 109 S.Ct., at 1076).  The new rule here is not among the \"small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that . . . are 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' \"  Graham, supra, 506 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 903 (some internal quotation marks omitted and citations omitted).  Because due process does not require a State to provide appellate process at all, Evitts, supra, 469 U.S., at 393, 105 S.Ct., at 834;  McKane v. Durston, 153 U.S. 684, 687, 14 S.Ct. 913, 914-915, 38 L.Ed. 867 (1894), a former fugitive's right to appeal cannot be said to \" 'be so central to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt,' \" Graham, supra, 506 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 903 (quoting Teague, supra, 489 U.S., at 313, 109 S.Ct., at 1077), as to fall within this exception to the Teague bar.\n\n\n13\nAs we explained in Allen v. Georgia, supra, 166 U.S., at 140, 17 S.Ct., at 526, where the Court upheld against constitutional attack the dismissal of the petition of a fugitive whose appeal was pending, \"if the Supreme Court of a State has acted in consonance with the constitutional laws of a State and its own procedure, it could only be in very exceptional circumstances that this court would feel justified in saying that there had been a failure of due legal process.  We might ourselves have pursued a different course in this case, but that is not the test.\"  The Eighth Circuit converted a rule for the administration of the federal courts into a constitutional one.  We do not (and we may not, in the face of the State's invocation of Teague ) reach the merits of that contention.  The result reached by the Court of Appeals was neither dictated nor compelled by existing precedent when Branch's conviction became final, and Teague prevents its application to her case.  The petition for certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n14\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Decided June 24, 2013\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Respondent Edward Schad was convicted of first-degree\nmurder and sentenced to death. After an extensive series of\nstate- and federal-court proceedings concluded with this\nCourt’s denial of respondent’s petitions for certiorari and\nfor rehearing, the Ninth Circuit declined to issue its\nmandate as normally required by Federal Rule of Appel­\nlate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D). The Ninth Circuit instead,\nsua sponte, construed respondent’s motion to stay the\nmandate pending the Ninth Circuit’s decision in a sepa­\nrate en banc case as a motion to reconsider a motion that\nit had denied six months earlier. Based on its review of\nthat previously rejected motion, the court issued a stay a\nfew days before respondent’s scheduled execution. Even\nassuming, as we did in Bell v. Thompson, 545 U.S. 794\n(2005), that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) admits of any exceptions, the\nNinth Circuit did not demonstrate that exceptional cir­\ncumstances justified withholding its mandate. As a result,\nwe conclude that the Ninth Circuit’s failure to issue its\nmandate constituted an abuse of discretion.\n                             I\n   In 1985, an Arizona jury found respondent guilty of\nfirst-degree murder for the 1978 strangling of 74-year-old\nLorimer Grove.1 The court sentenced respondent to death.\n——————\n 1A   state habeas court vacated an earlier guilty verdict and death\n2                         RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nAfter respondent’s conviction and sentence were affirmed\non direct review, see State v. Schad, 163 Ariz. 411, 788\nP.2d 1162 (1989), and Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624\n(1991), respondent again sought state habeas relief, alleg­\ning that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at\nsentencing by failing to discover and present sufficient\nmitigating evidence. The state courts denied relief.\n  In August 1998, respondent sought federal habeas relief.\nHe again raised a claim of ineffective assistance at sen­\ntencing for failure to present sufficient mitigating evi­\ndence. The District Court denied respondent’s request\nfor an evidentiary hearing to present new mitigating evi­\ndence, concluding that respondent was not diligent in\ndeveloping the evidence during his state habeas proceed­\nings. Schad v. Schriro, 454 F. Supp. 2d 897 (Ariz. 2006).\nThe District Court alternatively held that the proffered\nnew evidence did not demonstrate that trial counsel’s\nperformance was deficient. Id., at 940–947. The Ninth\nCircuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded\nto the District Court for a hearing to determine whether\nrespondent’s state habeas counsel was diligent in develop­\ning the state evidentiary record. Schad v. Ryan, 606 F.3d\n1022 (2010). Arizona petitioned for certiorari. This Court\ngranted the petition, vacated the Ninth Circuit’s opinion,\nand remanded for further proceedings in light of Cullen v.\nPinholster, 563 U. S. ___ (2011). See Ryan v. Schad, 563\nU. S. ___ (2011). On remand, the Ninth Circuit affirmed\nthe District Court’s denial of habeas relief. Schad v. Ryan,\n671 F.3d 708, 726 (2011). The Ninth Circuit subsequently\ndenied a motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc on\nFebruary 28, 2012.\n  On July 10, 2012, respondent filed in the Ninth Circuit\nthe first motion directly at issue in this case. This motion\n—————— \n\nsentence due to an error in jury instructions. See State v. Schad, 142\nAriz. 619, 691 P.2d 710 (1984). \n\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 (2012).2\nThe Ninth Circuit denied respondent’s motion on July 27,\n2012. Respondent then filed a petition for certiorari. This\nCourt denied the petition on October 9, 2012, 568 U.S.\n___, and denied a petition for rehearing on January 7,\n2013. 568 U.S. ___.\n   Respondent returned to the Ninth Circuit that day and\nfiled a motion requesting a stay of the mandate in light\nof a pending Ninth Circuit en banc case addressing the\ninteraction between Pinholster and Martinez. The Ninth\nCircuit denied the motion on February 1, 2013, “de-\nclin[ing] to issue an indefinite stay of the mandate that\nwould unduly interfere with Arizona’s execution process.”\nOrder in No. 07–99005, Doc. 102, p. 1. But instead of\nissuing the mandate, the court decided sua sponte to con­\nstrue respondent’s motion “as a motion to reconsider our\nprior denial of his Motion to Vacate Judgment and Re­\nmand in light of Martinez,” which the court had denied on\nJuly 27, 2012. Id., at 2. The court ordered briefing and, in\na divided opinion, remanded the case to the District Court\nto determine whether respondent could establish that he\nreceived ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel un­\nder Martinez, whether he could demonstrate prejudice\nas a result, and whether his underlying claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel had merit. No. 07–99005 (Feb.\n26, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. A–13 to A–15, 2013 WL\n791610, *6. Judge Graber dissented based on her conclu­\nsion that respondent could not show prejudice.

We are un­\naware of any explanation for respondent’s delay in bringing his\nMartinez-based argument to the Ninth Circuit’s attention.\n4                     RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\na motion for stay of execution on February 26, 2013. The\nNinth Circuit panel granted the motion on March 1, 2013,\nwith Judge Graber again noting her dissent.\n   On March 4, 2013, Arizona filed a petition for rehearing\nand rehearing en banc with the Ninth Circuit. The court\ndenied the petition the same day, with eight judges dis­\nsenting in two separate opinions. 709 F.3d 855 (2013).\n   On March 4, Arizona filed an application to vacate the\nstay of execution in this Court, along with a petition for\ncertiorari. This Court denied the application, with JUS-\nTICES SCALIA and ALITO noting that they would grant\nit. 568 U.S. ___ (2013). We now consider the petition.\n                             II\n   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D) sets\nforth the default rule that “[t]he court of appeals must\nissue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme\nCourt order denying the petition for writ of certiorari\nis filed.” (Emphasis added.) The reason for this Rule is\nstraightforward: “[T]he stay of mandate is entered solely\nto allow this Court time to consider a petition for certio­\nrari.” Bell, 545 U. S., at 806. Hence, once this Court has\ndenied a petition, there is generally no need for further\naction from the lower courts. See ibid. (“[A] decision by\nthis Court denying discretionary review usually signals\nthe end of litigation”). In Bell, Tennessee argued that\nRule 41(d)(2)(D) “admits of no exceptions, so the mandate\nshould have issued on the date” the Court of Appeals\nreceived notice of the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari.\nId., at 803. There was no need to resolve this issue in Bell\nbecause we concluded that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion even if Rule 41(d)(2)(D) authorized a stay of\nthe mandate after denial of certiorari. Id., at 803–804. As\nin Bell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that\nthe Ninth Circuit abused its discretion here.\n   Bell recognized that when state-court judgments are\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nreviewed in federal habeas proceedings, “finality and comity\nconcerns,” based in principles of federalism, demand\nthat federal courts “accord the appropriate level of respect\nto” state judgments by allowing them to be enforced\nwhen federal proceedings conclude. Id., at 812–813.\nAs we noted, States have an “ ‘ “interest in the finality of\nconvictions that have survived direct review within the\nstate court system.” ’ ” Id., at 813 (quoting Calderon v.\nThompson, 523 U.S. 538, 555 (1998), in turn quoting\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 635 (1993)). Else­\nwhere, we explained that “ ‘the profound interests in\nrepose’ attaching to the mandate of a court of appeals”\ndictate that “the power [to withdraw the mandate] can be\nexercised only in extraordinary circumstances.” Calderon,\nsupra, at 550 (quoting 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3938, p. 712 (2d\ned. 1996)). Deviation from normal mandate procedures is\na power “of last resort, to be held in reserve against grave,\nunforeseen contingencies.” Calderon, supra, at 550. Even\nassuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it\nabuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the mandate\nonce the Supreme Court has acted on the petition, unless\nextraordinary circumstances justify that action.\n   Applying this standard in Bell, we found no extraordi­\nnary circumstances that could constitute a miscarriage of\njustice. There, a capital defendant unsuccessfully alleged\nin state postconviction proceedings that his trial counsel\nhad been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient\nmitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial. 545\nU. S., at 797. On federal habeas review, he made the\nsame argument. Id., at 798. After the Sixth Circuit af­\nfirmed, the defendant filed a petition for rehearing that\n“placed substantial emphasis” on his argument that the\nSixth Circuit had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence.\nId., at 800. While the Sixth Circuit denied the petition, it\nstayed the issuance of its mandate while the defendant\n6                         RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nsought certiorari and, later, rehearing from the denial of\nthe writ. Ibid.\n   When this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the\nSixth Circuit did not issue its mandate. Instead, the Sixth\nCircuit waited five months (and until two days before the\nscheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that va-\ncated the District Court’s denial of habeas and remanded\nfor an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance-\nof-counsel claim. Id., at 800–801. This Court reversed\nthat decision, holding that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion due to its delay in issuing the mandate\nwithout notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously\nrejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federal­\nism principles.\n   In this case, the Ninth Circuit similarly abused its\ndiscretion when it did not issue the mandate. As in Bell,\nthe Ninth Circuit here declined to issue the mandate\nbased on an argument it had considered and rejected\nmonths earlier. And, by the time of the Ninth Circuit’s\nFebruary 1, 2013, decision not to issue its mandate, it had\nbeen over 10 months since we decided Martinez and nearly\n7 months since respondent unsuccessfully asked the Ninth\nCircuit to reconsider its decision in light of Martinez.3\n   Further, there is no doubt that the arguments presented\nin the rejected July 10, 2012, motion were identical to\nthose accepted by the Ninth Circuit the following Febru­\nary. Respondent styled his July 10 motion a “Motion to\nVacate Judgment and Remand to the District Court for\nAdditional Proceedings in Light of Martinez v. Ryan.” No.\n07–99005 (CA9), Doc. 88, p. 1. As its title suggests, the\nonly claim presented in that motion was that respondent’s\n\n——————\n    3 Respondentdid not even present the motion that the Ninth Circuit\nultimately reinstated until more than 4 months after the Ninth Circuit\ndenied respondent’s request for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc\nand more than 3½ months after Martinez was decided.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\npostconviction counsel should have developed more evi­\ndence to support his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim. Here, as in Bell, respondent’s July 10 motion\n“pressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted\nby the Court of Appeals.” 545 U. S., at 806. These ar-\nguments were pressed so strongly in the July 10 motion\nthat “[i]t is difficult to see how . . . counsel could have been\nclearer.” Id., at 808. The Ninth Circuit had a full “oppor­\ntunity to consider these arguments” but declined to do so,\nid., at 806, which “support[s] our determination that the\ndecision to withhold the mandate was in error.” Id., at\n806–807. We presume that the Ninth Circuit carefully\nconsiders each motion a capital defendant presents on\nhabeas review. See id., at 808 (rejecting the notion that\n“judges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of\na petition for rehearing”). As a result, there is no indica­\ntion that there were any extraordinary circumstances here\nthat called for the court to revisit an argument sua sponte\nthat it already explicitly rejected.\n   Finally, this case presents an additional issue not pre­\nsent in Bell. In refusing to issue the mandate, the Ninth\nCircuit panel relied heavily upon Beardslee v. Brown, 393\nF.3d 899, 901 (CA9 2004) (per curiam), Beardslee, which\nprecedes our Bell decision by more than six months, as­\nserts the Ninth Circuit’s inherent authority to withhold a\nmandate. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A–3 to A–4, 2013 WL\n791610, *1. But Beardslee was based on the Sixth Cir­\ncuit’s decision in Bell, which we reversed. See Beardslee,\nsupra, at 901 (citing Thompson v. Bell, 373 F.3d 688, 691–\n692 (2004)). That opinion, thus, provides no support for\nthe Ninth Circuit’s decision.\n   In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth Circuit\nabused its discretion when it neglected to issue its man­\ndate. The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\nNinth Circuit’s judgment is reversed, the stay of execution\n8                     RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nis vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to\nissue the mandate immediately and without any further\nproceedings.\n                                         It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\nNo. 95-354.\n\nSyllabus*\nArgued February 27, 1996\nDecided April 1, 1996\nAt age 56, petitioner was fired by respondent corporation and replacedby a 40-year-old worker.He then filed this suit, alleging that hisdischarge violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).The District Court granted respondent's summary judgmentmotion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitionerfailed to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination under McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, because he failed toshow that he was replaced by someone outside the age group protected bythe ADEA.\nHeld: Assuming that Title VII's McDonnell Douglas framework isapplicable to ADEA cases, there must be at least a logical connectionbetween each element of the prima facie case and the illegaldiscrimination.Replacement by someone under 40 fails this requirement.Although the ADEA limits its protection to those who are 40 or older,it prohibits discrimination against those protected employees on thebasis of age, not class membership.That one member of the protectedclass lost out to another member is irrelevant, so long as he lost outbecause of his age.The latter is more reliably indicated by the factthat his replacement was substantially younger than by the fact that hisreplacement was not a member of the protected class.56 F. 3d 542,reversed and remanded.\nJustice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents the question whether a plaintiff allegingthat he was discharged in violation of the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C.Section(s) 621 et seq., must show that he was replaced by someoneoutside the age group protected by the ADEA to make out a prima faciecase under the framework established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973).\n\n\n2\nPetitioner James O'Connor was employed by respondentConsolidated Coin Caterers Corporation from 1978 until August 10, 1990,when, at age 56, he was fired.Claiming that he had been dismissedbecause of his age in violation of the ADEA, petitioner brought suit inthe United States District Court for the Western District of NorthCarolina.After discovery, the District Court granted respondent'smotion for summary judgment, 829 F. Supp. 155 (1993), and petitionerappealed.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated thatpetitioner could establish a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglasonly if he could prove that (1) he was in the age group protected by theADEA; (2) he was discharged or demoted; (3) at the time of his dischargeor demotion, he was performing his job at a level that met hisemployer's legitimate expectations; and (4) following his discharge ordemotion, he was replaced by someone of comparable qualificationsoutside the protected class.Since petitioner's replacement was 40years old, the Court of Appeals concluded that the last element of theprima facie case had not been made out.156 F. 3d 542, 546 (1995).Finding that petitioner's claim could not survive a motion for summaryjudgment without benefit of the McDonnell Douglas presumption (i.e.,\"under the ordinary standards of proof used in civil cases,\" 56 F. 3d,at 548), the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of dismissal.Wegranted O'Connor's petition for certiorari.516 U. S. ___ (1995).\n\n\n3\nIn McDonnell Douglas, we \"established an allocation of theburden of production and an order for the presentation of proof in TitleVII discriminatory-treatment cases.\"St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,509 U. S. 502, 506 (1993).We held that a plaintiff alleging racialdiscrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of1964, 42 U. S. C. Section(s) 2000e et seq., could establish a primafacie case by showing \"(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii)that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer wasseeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he wasrejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained openand the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of [the]complainant's qualifications.\"McDonnell Douglas, 411 U. S., at 802.Once the plaintiff has met this initial burden, the burden of productionshifts to the employer \"to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatoryreason for the employee's rejection.\" Ibid. If the trier of fact findsthat the elements of the prima facie case are supported by apreponderance of the evidence and the employer remains silent, the courtmust enter judgment for the plaintiff.  St. Mary's Honor Center, supra,at 509-510, and n. 3; Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450U. S. 248, 254 (1981).\n\n\n4\nIn assessing claims of age discrimination brought under theADEA, the Fourth Circuit, like others,2 has applied some variant ofthe basic evidentiary framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas.We havenever had occasion to decide whether that application of the Title VIIrule to the ADEA context is correct, but since the parties do notcontest that point, we shall assume it.Cf. St. Mary's Honor Center,supra, at 506 n. 1 (assuming that \"the McDonnell Douglas framework isfully applicable to racial-discrimination-in-employment claims under 42U. S. C. Section(s) 1983\"). On that assumption, the question presentedfor our determination is what elements must be shown in an ADEA case toestablish the prima facie case that triggers the employer's burden ofproduction.\n\n\n5\nAs the very name \"prima facie case\" suggests, there must be atleast a logical connection between each element of the prima facie caseand the illegal discrimination for which it establishes a \"legallymandatory, rebuttable presumption,\" Burdine, supra, at 254, n. 7.Theelement of replacement by someone under 40 fails this requirement.Thediscrimination prohibited by the ADEA is discrimination \"because of [an]individual's age,\" 29 U. S. C. Section(s) 623(a)(1), though theprohibition is \"limited to individuals who are at least 40 years ofage,\" Section(s) 631(a). This language does not ban discriminationagainst employees because they are aged 40 or older; it bansdiscrimination against employees because of their age, but limits theprotected class to those who are 40 or older.The fact that one personin the protected class has lost out to another person in the protectedclass is thus irrelevant, so long as he has lost out because of his age.Or to put the point more concretely, there can be no greater inferenceof age discrimination (as opposed to \"40 or over\" discrimination) when a40 year-old is replaced by a 39 year-old than when a 56 year-old isreplaced by a 40 year-old.Because it lacks probative value, the factthat an ADEA plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protectedclass is not a proper element of the McDonnell Douglas prima facie case.\n\n\n6\nPerhaps some courts have been induced to adopt the principleurged by respondent in order to avoid creating a prima facie case on thebasis of very thin evidence-for example, the replacement of a 68year-old by a 65 year-old.While the respondent's principletheoretically permits such thin evidence (consider the example above ofa 40 year-old replaced by a 39 year-old), as a practical matter it willrarely do so, since the vast majority of age-discrimination claims comefrom older employees.In our view, however, the proper solution to theproblem lies not in making an utterly irrelevant factor an element ofthe prima facie case, but rather in recognizing that the prima faciecase requires \"evidence adequate to create an inference that anemployment decision was based on a[n] [illegal] discriminatory criterion. . . .\"Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 358 (1977)(emphasis added).In the age-discrimination context, such an inferencecan not be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another workerinsignificantly younger.Because the ADEA prohibits discrimination onthe basis of age and not class membership, the fact that a replacementis substantially younger than the plaintiff is a far more reliableindicator of age discrimination than is the fact that the plaintiff wasreplaced by someone outside the protected class. The judgment of theFourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n7\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Courtbut has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenienceof the reader.See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321,337.\n\n\n1\n The court also concluded that even under a modifiedversion of the McDonnell Douglas prima facie standard which the FourthCircuit applies to reduction-in-force cases, see Mitchell v. DataGeneral Corp., 12 F. 3d 1310, 1315 (1993), petitioner could not prevail.We limit our review to the Fourth Circuit's treatment of this case as anon-reduction-in-force case.\n\n\n2\n See, e.g., Roper v.

We have\r\nemphasized, time and again, that the Antiterrorism and\r\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat.\r\n1214, prohibits the federal courts of appeals from rely-\r\ning on their own precedent to conclude that a particular\r\nconstitutional principle is “clearly established.” See, e.g.,\r\nMarshall v. Rodgers, 569 U. S. __, __ (2013) (per curiam)\r\n(slip op. at 6). Because the Ninth Circuit failed to comply\r\nwith this rule, we reverse its decision granting habeas\r\nrelief to respondent Marvin Smith.\r\n                              I\r\n   Respondent was arrested for the murder of his wife,\r\nMinnie Smith. On December 15, 2005, Mrs. Smith was\r\nfound dead in the home she shared with respondent, and\r\nit was determined that she was killed by a massive blow to\r\nthe head from a fireplace log roller. The home appeared to\r\nhave been ransacked, and valuable jewelry was missing.\r\n   The State charged respondent with first-degree murder\r\nand offered substantial incriminating evidence at trial.\r\nThe prosecution presented evidence that respondent “was\r\nunfaithful to his wife for many years, that his wife was\r\n2                      LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                         Per Curiam\r\n\r\nthreatening to divorce him, and that he told one of his\r\nformer employees . . . that the ‘only way’ he or his wife\r\nwould get out of their marriage was ‘to die,’ because he\r\nwas ‘not going to give [Mrs. Smith] half of what [he] got so\r\nsome other man can live off of it.’ ” 731 F.3d 859, 862–863\r\n(CA9 2013) (second alteration in original). Respondent’s\r\nDNA was also found on the murder weapon, pieces of duct\r\ntape found near the body, and a burned matchstick that\r\nwas found in the bedroom and that may have been used to\r\ninflict burns on the body. See id., at 863; see also People v.\r\nSmith, 2010 WL 4975500, *1–*2 (Cal. App., Dec. 8, 2010).\r\nThe missing jewelry was discovered in the trunk of re-\r\nspondent’s car, wrapped in duct tape from the same roll\r\nthat had provided the pieces found near the body. See 731\nF.3d, at 863. Respondent’s DNA was found on the duct\r\ntape in his trunk. See Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *2. In\r\naddition, a criminologist testified that the ransacking of\r\nthe Smiths’ home appeared to have been staged. See 731\nF.3d, at 863.\r\n  Respondent defended in part on the basis that he could\r\nnot have delivered the fatal blow due to rotator cuff sur-\r\ngery several weeks before the murder. See ibid. (He\r\nmounted this defense despite the fact that police had\r\nobserved him wielding a 6-foot-long 2 by 4 to pry some-\r\nthing out of a concrete slab at a construction site the week\r\nafter the murder. See Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *1.)\r\nThe defense also suggested that one of respondent’s former\r\nemployees had committed the crime to obtain money to\r\npay a debt he owed respondent. See 731 F.3d, at 863.\r\n  At the close of evidence, the prosecution requested an\r\naiding-and-abetting instruction, and the trial court agreed\r\nto give such an instruction. During closing argument, the\r\nprosecutor contended that respondent was physically able\r\nto wield the log roller that had killed Mrs. Smith, but he\r\nalso informed the jury that, even if respondent had not\r\ndelivered the fatal blow, he could still be convicted on an\r\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\r\n\r\n                          Per Curiam\r\n\r\naiding-and-abetting theory. See id., at 864. The jury\r\nconvicted respondent of first-degree murder without speci-\r\nfying which theory of guilt it adopted.\r\n   After a series of state-court proceedings not relevant\r\nhere, the California Court of Appeal affirmed respondent’s\r\nconviction. The state court rejected respondent’s assertion\r\nthat he had inadequate notice of the possibility of con-\r\nviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory. The court ex-\r\nplained that “ ‘an accusatory pleading charging a defend-\r\nant with murder need not specify the theory of murder on\r\nwhich the prosecution intends to rely,’ ” and noted that the\r\n“information charged defendant with murder in compli-\r\nance with the governing statutes.” Smith, 2010 WL\n4975500, at *6–*7. Furthermore, the court held that “even\r\nif this case required greater specificity concerning the\r\nbasis of defendant’s liability, the evidence presented at his\r\npreliminary examination provided it.” Id., at *7. The\r\nupshot was that “the information and preliminary exami-\r\nnation testimony adequately notified defendant he could\r\nbe prosecuted for murder as an aider and abettor.” Id., at\r\n*8. The California Supreme Court denied respondent’s\r\npetition for review.\r\n   Respondent filed a petition for habeas relief with the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of\r\nCalifornia. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting\r\nrelief, and the District Court summarily adopted the\r\nMagistrate Judge’s recommendation.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court acknowledged\r\nthat the “information charging [respondent] with first-\r\ndegree murder was initially sufficient to put him on notice\r\nthat he could be convicted either as a principal or as an\r\naider-and-abettor,” because under California law “aiding\r\nand abetting a crime is the same substantive offense as\r\nperpetrating the crime.” 731 F.3d, at 868. But the Ninth\r\nCircuit nevertheless concluded that respondent’s Sixth\r\nAmendment and due process right to notice had been\r\n4                     LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                         Per Curiam\r\n\r\nviolated because it believed the prosecution (until it re-\r\nquested the aiding-and-abetting jury instruction) had tried\r\nthe case only on the theory that respondent himself had\r\ndelivered the fatal blow. See id., at 869.\r\n  The Ninth Circuit did not purport to identify any case in\r\nwhich we have found notice constitutionally inadequate\r\nbecause, although the defendant was initially adequately\r\napprised of the offense against him, the prosecutor focused\r\nat trial on one potential theory of liability at the expense\r\nof another. Rather, it found the instant case to be “indis-\r\ntinguishable from” the Ninth Circuit’s own decision in\r\nSheppard v. Rees, 909 F.2d 1234 (1989), which the court\r\nthought “faithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court.” 731 F.3d, at 868. The court also\r\nrejected, as an “unreasonable determination of the facts,”\r\n28 U.S. C. §2254(d)(2), the California Court of Appeal’s\r\nconclusion that preliminary examination testimony and\r\nthe jury instructions conference put respondent on notice\r\nof the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. See id., at 871–872.\r\n                             II\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  The Ninth Circuit held, and respondent does not dis-\r\npute, that respondent initially received adequate notice of\r\nthe possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting\r\ntheory. The question is therefore whether habeas relief is\r\nwarranted because the State principally relied at trial on\r\nthe theory that respondent himself delivered the fatal\r\nblow.\r\n  Assuming, arguendo, that a defendant is entitled to\r\nnotice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-\r\nabetting theory, the Ninth Circuit’s grant of habeas relief\r\nmay be affirmed only if this Court’s cases clearly establish\r\nthat a defendant, once adequately apprised of such a\r\npossibility, can nevertheless be deprived of adequate\r\n                      Cite as: 574 U.

The Ninth Circuit pointed to no\r\ncase of ours holding as much. Instead, the Court of Ap-\r\npeals cited three older cases that stand for nothing more\r\nthan the general proposition that a defendant must have\r\nadequate notice of the charges against him. See 731 F.3d,\r\nat 866–867 (citing Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749,\r\n763–764 (1962); In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273–274\r\n(1948); Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 201 (1948)).\r\n   This proposition is far too abstract to establish clearly\r\nthe specific rule respondent needs. We have before cau-\r\ntioned the lower courts—and the Ninth Circuit in particu-\r\nlar—against “framing our precedents at such a high level\r\nof generality.” Nevada v. Jackson, 569 U. S. ___, ___\r\n(2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7). None of our decisions\r\nthat the Ninth Circuit cited addresses, even remotely, the\r\nspecific question presented by this case. See Russell,\r\nsupra, at 752 (indictment for “refus[ing] to answer any\r\nquestion pertinent to [a] question under [congressional]\r\ninquiry,” 2 U.S. C. §192, failed to “identify the subject\r\nunder congressional subcommittee inquiry”); In re Oliver,\r\nsupra, at 259 (instantaneous indictment, conviction, and\r\nsentence by judge acting as grand jury with no prior notice\r\nof charge to defendant); Cole, supra, at 197 (affirmance of\r\ncriminal convictions “under a . . . statute for violation of\r\nwhich [defendants] had not been charged”).1\r\n   Because our case law does not clearly establish the legal\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   1 Respondent claims that our decision in Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U.S.\n110 (1991), although not cited by the Ninth Circuit, clearly establishes\r\nthe legal principle he needs. But Lankford is of no help to respondent.\r\nThat case addressed whether a defendant had adequate notice of the\r\npossibility of imposition of the death penalty—a far different question\r\nfrom whether respondent had adequate notice of the particular theory\r\nof liability. See id., at 111. In Lankford, moreover, the trial court itself\r\nmade specific statements that encouraged the defendant to believe that\r\nthe death penalty was off the table. See id., at 116–117.\r\n6                      LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                          Per Curiam\r\n\r\nproposition needed to grant respondent habeas relief, the\r\nNinth Circuit was forced to rely heavily on its own deci-\r\nsion in Sheppard, supra. Of course, AEDPA permits\r\nhabeas relief only if a state court’s decision is “contrary to,\r\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\r\nlished Federal law” as determined by this Court, not by\r\nthe courts of appeals. 28 U.S. C. §2254(d)(1). The Ninth\r\nCircuit attempted to evade this barrier by holding that\r\nSheppard “faithfully applied the principles enunciated by\r\nthe Supreme Court in Cole, Oliver, and Russell.” 731\nF.3d, at 868. But Circuit precedent cannot “refine or\r\nsharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurispru-\r\ndence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not\r\nannounced.” Marshall, 569 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 6).\r\nSheppard is irrelevant to the question presented by this\r\ncase: whether our case law clearly establishes that a pros-\r\necutor’s focus on one theory of liability at trial can render\r\nearlier notice of another theory of liability inadequate.\r\n                             B\r\n  The Ninth Circuit also disagreed with what it termed\r\nthe state court’s “determination of the facts”—principally,\r\nthe state court’s holding that preliminary examination\r\ntestimony and the prosecutors’ request for an aiding-and-\r\nabetting jury instruction shortly before closing arguments\r\nadequately put respondent on notice of the prosecution’s\r\naiding-and-abetting theory. 731 F.3d, at 871 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit therefore\r\ngranted relief under §2254(d)(2), which permits habeas\r\nrelief where the state-court “decision . . . was based on an\r\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\r\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.” That\r\nholding cannot be sustained.\r\n  In purporting to reject the state court’s “determination\r\nof the facts,” the Ninth Circuit focused on preliminary\r\nexamination testimony by an investigator about conversa-\r\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\r\n\r\n                           Per Curiam\r\n\r\ntions between respondent and his cellmate. According to\r\nthe investigator, the cellmate stated that respondent told\r\nhim that respondent “had to get rid of his wife because she\r\nwas standing in the way of his future plans; that she was\r\nthreatening to divorce him and he wasn’t going to give up\r\nhalf of his property”; that respondent made his house look\r\nlike the site of a home invasion robbery; and that, when he\r\nleft for work the morning of the murder, he left the win-\r\ndow open and did not set the alarm. Smith, 2010 WL\n4975500, at *7. The investigator also testified that the\r\ncellmate did not “ ‘know any of the details of the homicide\r\nitself and how it was carried out,’ ” and that respondent\r\n“ ‘never told [the cellmate] specifically who’ ” committed the\r\nhomicide. Ibid. The California Court of Appeal held that\r\nthese statements, taken together, suggested that respond-\r\nent was involved in planning and facilitating the crime but\r\nthat the fatal blow might have been delivered by an ac-\r\ncomplice. Ibid. Thus, the California court believed that\r\neven assuming that the information by itself was not\r\nsufficient, this testimony naturally lent itself to conviction\r\non an aiding-and-abetting theory and so gave respondent\r\neven greater notice of such a possibility. Ibid.\r\n   The Ninth Circuit also focused on the jury instructions\r\nconference, which occurred after the defense rested but\r\nbefore the parties’ closing arguments. During that confer-\r\nence, prosecutors requested an aiding-and-abetting in-\r\nstruction, which further provided notice to respondent.\r\nThe California Court of Appeal concluded that this case is\r\ndistinguishable from Sheppard v. Rees, 909 F.2d 1234,\r\nbecause, unlike that case, the conference here did not\r\noccur immediately before closing arguments. The Ninth\r\nCircuit disagreed, holding that because “defense counsel\r\nhad only the lunch recess to formulate a response” to the\r\naiding-and-abetting instruction, this case “is indistin-\r\nguishable from Sheppard,” where the prosecution also\r\n“requested the new instruction the same day as closing.”\r\n8                          LOPEZ v. SMITH\r\n\r\n                              Per Curiam\n731 F.3d, at 868, 870.\r\n   Although the Ninth Circuit claimed its disagreement\r\nwith the state court was factual in nature, in reality its\r\ngrant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the\r\nadequacy of the notice provided. The Ninth Circuit be-\r\nlieved that the events detailed above, even when taken\r\ntogether with the information filed against respondent,\r\nfailed to measure up to the standard of notice applicable in\r\ncases like this. That ranked as a legal determination\r\ngoverned by §2254(d)(1), not one of fact governed by\r\n§2254(d)(2). But, as we have explained, the Ninth Circuit\r\ncited only its own precedent for establishing the appropri-\r\nate standard. Absent a decision of ours clearly establish-\r\ning the relevant standard, the Ninth Circuit had nothing\r\nagainst which it could assess, and deem lacking, the notice\r\nafforded respondent by the information and proceedings.\r\nIt therefore had no basis to reject the state court’s assess-\r\nment that respondent was adequately apprised of the pos-\r\nsibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.2\r\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The\r\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\r\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                                     It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n    2 Because we reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision on the foregoing\r\ngrounds, we need not opine on the correctness of that court’s discussion\r\nof Griffin v.

Christine McDERMOTT et al.\nNos. 92-5584, 92-5618.\nNov. 2, 1992.\n\nRehearing Denied Dec. 7, 1992.\nSee U.S. , 113 S.Ct. 652.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPro se petitioner James L. Martin requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court.  We deny this request pursuant to our Rule 39.8.  Martin is allowed until November 23, 1992, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.  We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Martin in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\n\n\n2\nMartin is a notorious abuser of this Court's certiorari process.  We first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Martin in forma pauperis status last November.  See Zatko v. California, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 355, 116 L.Ed.2d 293 (1991) (per curiam).  At that time, we noted that Martin had filed 45 petitions in the past 10 years, and 15 in the preceding 2 years alone.  Although Martin was granted in forma pauperis status to file these petitions, all of these petitions were denied without recorded dissent.  In invoking Rule 39.8, we observed that Martin is \"unique—not merely among those who seek to file in forma pauperis, but also among those who have paid the required filing fees—because [he has] repeatedly made totally frivolous demands on the Court's limited resources.\" Id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 356-357.  Unfortunately, Martin has continued in his accustomed ways.\n\n\n3\nSince we first denied him in forma pauperis status last year, he has filed nine petitions for certiorari with this Court.  We denied Martin leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39.8 of this Court with respect to four of these petitions,1 and denied the remaining five petitions outright.2  Two additional petitions for certiorari are before us today, bringing the total number of petitions Martin has filed in the past year to 11. With the arguable exception of one of these petitions, see Martin v. Knox, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 620, 116 L.Ed.2d 642 (1991) (Stevens, J., joined by Blackmun, J., concurring in denial of certiorari), all of Martin's filings, including those before us today, have been demonstrably frivolous.\n\n\n4\nIn Zatko, we warned that \"[f]uture similar filings from [Martin] will merit additional measures.\"  502 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 357.  As we have recognized, \"[e]very paper filed with the Clerk of this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources.  A part of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests of justice.\" In re McDonald, 489 U.S. 180, 184, 109 S.Ct. 993, 996, 103 L.Ed.2d 158 (1989) (per curiam).  Consideration of Martin's repetitious and frivolous petitions for certiorari does not promote this end.\n\n\n5\nWe have entered orders similar to the present one on two previous occasions to prevent pro se petitioners from filing repetitious and frivolous requests for extraordinary relief.  See In re Sindram, 498 U.S. 177, 111 S.Ct. 596, 112 L.Ed.2d 599 (1991) (per curiam);  In re McDonald, supra.  Although this case does not involve abuse of an extraordinary writ, but rather the writ of certiorari, Martin's pattern of abuse has had a similarly deleterious effect on this Court's \"fair allocation of judicial resources.\"  See In re Sindram, supra, at 180, 111 S.Ct., at 597. As a result, the same concerns which led us to enter the orders barring prospective filings in Sindram and McDonald require such action here.\n\n\n6\nWe regret the necessity of taking this step, but Martin's refusal to heed our earlier warning leaves us no choice.  His abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly.  The order will therefore not prevent Martin from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him.  But it will free this Court's limited resources to consider the claims of those petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.\n\n\n7\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n8\nJustice STEVENS, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.\n\n\n9\nIn my opinion the judicial resources of the Court could be used more effectively by simply denying Martin's petitions than by drafting, entering, and policing the order the Court enters today. The theoretical administrative benefit the Court may derive from an order of this kind is far outweighed by the shadow it casts on the great tradition of open access that characterized the Court's history prior to its unprecedented decisions in In re McDonald, 489 U.S. 180, 109 S.Ct. 993, 103 L.Ed.2d 158 (1989) (per curiam) and In re Sindram, 498 U.S. 177, 111 S.Ct. 596, 112 L.Ed.2d 599 (1991) (per curiam).  I continue to adhere to the views expressed in the dissenting opinions filed in those cases, and in the dissenting opinion I filed in Zatko v. California, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 355, ----, 116 L.Ed.2d 293 (1991) (per curiam). See also Talamini v.

The verdict form in the trial's penalty phase required, in relevant part, the jury to check a box indicating that it found unanimously either at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances or one or more aggravating circumstances outweighing any mitigating circumstances. The jury marked the latter box. After respondent's direct appeal was denied, this Court held that the Constitution prohibits a State from requiring jurors unanimously to agree that a particular mitigating circumstance exists before they may consider that circumstance in their sentencing determination, Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, 374. In subsequent state postconviction proceedings, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected respondent's claim that the instructions to the jury and the verdict forms in his case suggested that the mitigating circumstance findings had to be unanimous. In denying his later federal habeas petition, the District Court did not address whether Mills was retroactive, finding instead the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) review standard dispositive. The Third Circuit reversed in part, granting relief under Mills. It found that it did not need to evaluate whether Mills applied retroactively per Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, because the State Supreme Court had not ruled on retroactivity, and it found the state court's application of federal law unreasonable under Mills and Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370.\nHeld: The Third Circuit erred when it failed to perform a Teague analysis. Whether to apply the Teague rule — that new constitutional rules of criminal procedure generally do not apply to cases that became final before the new rules were announced, 489 U. S., at 310 — is a threshold question in every habeas case. A federal court may decline to apply Teague if a State does not argue it; but if the State does argue Teague, the court must apply it before considering the claim's merits. Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383. Here, petitioners raised the Teague issue both in the District Court and in the Third Circuit. To the extent that the latter court's opinion can be read to imply that AEDPA has changed Caspari's legal principles, none of this Court's post-AEDPA cases have suggested that habeas should automatically issue if a prisoner satisfies the AEDPA review standard or that AEDPA relieves courts from the responsibility of addressing properly raised Teague arguments.\nCertiorari granted; reversed and remanded.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granted respondent federal habeas corpus relief from his death sentence. 271 F. 3d 527 (2001). Applying the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) standard of review,1 the Court of Appeals concluded that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had unreasonably applied federal law in evaluating respondent's claim that his penalty phase jury instructions and verdict forms were improper under Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988). The Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to evaluate whether Mills applies retroactively to cases on habeas review per Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had not ruled on retroactivity. 271 F. 3d, at 541-543. In avoiding the Teague issue, the Court of Appeals directly contravened Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383 (1994), in which we held that federal courts must address the Teague question when it is properly argued by the government. We thus grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse the Court of Appeals' determination that a Teague analysis was unnecessary.2\n\n\n2\nRespondent, George Banks, was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder stemming from a series of shootings on September 25, 1982. During the penalty phase of his trial, the jury was instructed, in part:\n\n\n3\n\"The sentence you impose will depend upon your findings concerning aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The Crime[s] Code in this Commonwealth provides that the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance, or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstance or circumstances.\" Commonwealth v. Banks, 540 Pa. 143, 150, 656 A. 2d 467, 470 (1995).\n\n\n4\nIn relevant part, the verdict form required the jury to check a box indicating that \"[w]e the jury have found unanimously\" either \"[a]t least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances,\" or \"[o]ne or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstance or circumstances.\" 271 F. 3d, at 549-550. The jury marked the latter box, and also checked two other boxes indicating the aggravating circumstance (multiple offenses punishable by at least life in prison) and mitigating circumstance (extreme mental or emotional disturbance) that it had found. Respondent was sentenced to death on each count of first-degree murder.\n\n\n5\nAfter respondent's direct appeal was denied, we decided Mills, in which we held that the Constitution prohibits a State from requiring jurors unanimously to agree that a particular mitigating circumstance exists before they are permitted to consider that circumstance in their sentencing determination. 486 U. S., at 374. Subsequently, in state postconviction proceedings, respondent raised a Mills challenge to the jury instructions and verdict forms in his case, arguing that they improperly \"suggested to the jury that its findings as to mitigating circumstances must be unanimous.\" 540 Pa., at 149, 656 A. 2d, at 470. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected his claim: \"[B]oth the verbal instructions given by the court as well as the instructions printed on the verdict slips were correct and not impermissibly suggestive of a unanimity requirement with respect to mitigating circumstances.\" Id., at 153, 656 A. 2d, at 471.\n\n\n6\nRespondent petitioned for federal habeas relief, which the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denied. 63 F. Supp. 2d 525 (1999). The District Court rejected respondent's Mills claim on the merits, applying the AEDPA standard of review articulated in 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d): \"Supreme Court precedent ... did not require an outcome contrary to that reached by the state courts.\" 63 F. Supp. 2d, at 544. Because the court found the AEDPA standard of review dispositive, it did \"not address the parties' arguments concerning the retroactivity of Mills.\" Ibid.\n\n\n7\nThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court in part, granting respondent relief from his death sentence under Mills. The Court of Appeals first asked: \"Are we compelled to conduct a retroactivity analysis under Teague?\" 271 F. 3d, at 541. It recognized that, per Teague, retroactivity is a \"`threshold question,'\" but it found \"Teague not to govern [its] analysis\" in this case because \"we do not need to focus on anything other than the reasoning and determination of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,\" which had not ruled on retroactivity. 271 F. 3d, at 541, and n. 13.3 It rejected petitioners' contention that the state court's failure to rule on retroactivity was irrelevant to whether Teague should apply in federal court: \"Teague teaches that the federal courts habeas corpus proceeding should be reluctant to apply new rules of federal jurisprudence in state court cases decided before such new rules were handed down. Principles of comity and finality counsel that we maintain a circumscribed scope of habeas review... Here, however as we have noted, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court applied Mills. We are examining the application of Mills, not because we wish to impose a new rule not considered by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, but as the court in fact did consider and apply it. In such a situation, Teague is not implicated. Accordingly, we need ask only whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's application of Mills should be disturbed under the AEDPA standards.\" 271 F. 3d, at 543 (citation omitted).\n\n\n8\nFreed from performing a Teague analysis concerning Mills' retroactivity, a question which has created some disagreement among the Federal Circuits,4 the Court of Appeals asked \"whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determination regarding the constitutionality of the instructions, verdict slip, and polling of the jury involved an unreasonable application of Mills.\" 271 F. 3d, at 544. It then found the state court's application of federal law unreasonable under the standards of 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d), relying on both Mills and Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990). 271 F. 3d, at 551. The Court of Appeals explained that, \"[c]onsidered as a whole, the jury instructions leave no doubt that `there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.'\" Id., at 549 (quoting Boyde, supra, at 380).\n\n\n9\nPetitioners seek a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Court of Appeals erred by not performing a Teague analysis, by applying Mills retroactively to respondent's case, and by concluding that the state court's decision was unreasonable under Mills. We find it unnecessary to resolve the latter two of these claims, because we determine that the Court of Appeals committed a clear error by failing to perform a Teague analysis.\n\n\n10\nIn Teague, we explained that \"[u]nless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.\" 489 U. S., at 310.5 And in Caspari, we held that \"[a] threshold question in every habeas case, therefore, is whether the court is obligated to apply the Teague rule to the defendant's claim.... [A] federal court may, but need not, decline to apply Teague if the State does not argue it. But if the State does argue that the defendant seeks the benefit of a new rule of constitutional law, the court must apply Teague before considering the merits of the claim.\" 510 U. S., at 389 (citations omitted). Here, petitioners raised the Teague issue both in the District Court, see 63 F. Supp. 2d, at 544, and in the Court of Appeals, see 271 F. 3d, at 542-543. Thus, per Caspari, a case not cited in the opinion below, it was incumbent upon the Court of Appeals to perform a Teague analysis before granting respondent relief under Mills. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that it did \"not need to focus on anything other than the reasoning and determination of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\" 271 F. 3d, at 541.\n\n\n11\nAlthough the Court of Appeals may have simply overlooked Caspari, its opinion can also be read to imply that AEDPA has changed the relevant legal principles articulated in Caspari, see 271 F. 3d, at 541, n. 13 (\"We note, however, that recent decisions have called into question to what extent Teague has continued force independent of AEDPA\"). While it is of course a necessary prerequisite to federal habeas relief that a prisoner satisfy the AEDPA standard of review set forth in 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d) (\"[a]n application ... shall not be granted ... unless\" the AEDPA standard of review is satisfied (emphasis added)), none of our post-AEDPA cases have suggested that a writ of habeas corpus should automatically issue if a prisoner satisfies the AEDPA standard, or that AEDPA relieves courts from the responsibility of addressing properly raised Teague arguments. To the contrary, if our post-AEDPA cases suggest anything about AEDPA's relationship to Teague, it is that the AEDPA and Teague inquiries are distinct. See, e. g., Tyler v. Cain, 533 U. S. 656, 669-670 (2001) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (construing successive application provisions of AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. § 2244(b)(2)(A)); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412-413 (2000) (construing § 2254(d)). Thus, in addition to performing any analysis required by AEDPA, a federal court considering a habeas petition must conduct a threshold Teague analysis when the issue is properly raised by the state.\n\n\n12\nWe reverse the Court of Appeals' holding that \"Teague is not implicated\" by this case, 271 F. 3d, at 543, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n13\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n1\n Title 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d) was modified by AEDPA and now provides, in part, that \"[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim ... resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n\n\n2\n We also grant respondent's motion for leave to proceedin forma pauperis.\n\n\n3\n In deciding not to conduct aTeague analysis, the Court of Appeals \"acknowledge[d] further that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has specifically noted its skepticism regarding the retroactive application of Mills\" and has disagreed with the Court of Appeals' resolution of Mills claims similar to respondent's. 271 F. 3d, at 542.\n\n\n4\n CompareGall v. Parker, 231 F. 3d 265, 322 (CA6 2000) (Teague does not bar retroactive application of Mills), and Williams v. Dixon, 961 F. 2d 448, 456 (CA4 1992) (same), with Miller v. Lockhart, 65 F. 3d 676, 685-686 (CA8 1995) (Teague bars retroactive application of Mills), and Cordova v.

On state postconviction review, he argued that he had not been convicted of an offense for which a death sentence could be imposed because the indictment did not charge him as a \"principal offender\" under the relevant Ohio statute. The Ohio appellate court, however, held that literal compliance with the statute was not required where, as here, only one defendant is named in the indictment. That court also rejected respondent's second state postconviction petition, which alleged, inter alia, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for not arguing that the State's failure to comply with its sentencing procedures violated the Eighth Amendment. In granting respondent's subsequent federal habeas petition, the District Court concluded that the state court's decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Eighth Amendment precluded respondent's death sentence and that harmless-error review was inappropriate.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit exceeded the limits imposed on federal habeas review by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), which permits federal habeas relief only if the State's adjudication on the merits resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. This Court's precedents do not support the Sixth Circuit's conclusion that Ohio's failure to charge respondent as a \"principal\" was the functional equivalent to dispensing with the reasonable-doubt requirement. In noncapital cases, this Court has often held that the trial court's failure to instruct a jury on all of the statutory elements is subject to harmless-error analysis. The Court's precedents do not require the opposite result where the violation occurs in a capital sentencing proceeding. Indeed, a number of this Court's harmless-error cases have involved capital defendants. Because the Ohio appellate court's decision does not conflict with the reasoning or holdings of this Court's precedent, it is not contrary to clearly established federal law. Nor is it an unreasonable application of federal law. Habeas relief is appropriate only if the state court applied harmless-error review in an \"objectively unreasonable\" manner. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 75-77. That is not the case here. The Ohio Supreme Court has defined a principal offender as the actual killer, and the jury instructions show that the verdict would surely have been the same had the jury been instructed to find the respondent a \"principal\" in the offense. After all, he was the only person charged in the indictment, and there was no evidence that anyone else was involved.\nCertiorari granted; 310 F. 3d 414, reversed and remanded.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the grant of habeas relief to respondent Gregory Esparza after concluding that, because the Eighth Amendment requires the State to narrow the class of death eligible defendants, the Ohio Court of Appeals had improperly subjected respondent's claims to harmless-error review. 310 F. 3d 414 (2002). This decision ignores the limits imposed on federal habeas review by 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d), and we therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.\n\n\n2\nIn February 1983, respondent Esparza entered a store in Toledo, Ohio, and approached two employees, Melanie Gerschultz and James Barailloux. No one else was in the store. At gunpoint, he ordered Gerschultz to open the cash register. Barailloux meanwhile fled the store through a rear door, entering the attached home of the storeowner, Evelyn Krieger. As Barailloux was alerting Krieger to the robbery, he heard a gunshot. Barailloux and Krieger returned to the store and found Gerschultz lying on the floor, fatally wounded by a single gunshot to her neck. The cash register was open and approximately $110 was missing.\n\n\n3\nRespondent was charged with aggravated murder during the commission of an aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2903.01 (Anderson 2002), and aggravated robbery, § 2911.01. He was convicted on both counts, and the trial judge accepted the jury's recommendation that he be sentenced to death for the murder conviction. The trial judge additionally sentenced respondent to 7 to 25 years' imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus 3 years for the firearm specification. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentences. State v. Esparza, 39 Ohio St. 3d 8, 529 N. E. 2d 192 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1012 (1989).\n\n\n4\nOn state postconviction review, respondent argued, for the first time, that he had not been convicted of an offense for which a death sentence could be imposed under Ohio law. Although the indictment charged him with aggravated murder in the course of committing aggravated robbery, it did not charge him as a \"principal offender.\"1 The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected his claim, holding that literal compliance with the statute was not required: \"[W]here only one defendant is named in an indictment alleging felony murder, it would be redundant to state that the defendant is being charged as a principal offender. Only where more than one defendant is named need the indictment specify the allegation `principal offender.'\" State v. Esparza, No. L-90-235, 1992 WL 113827, *9 (May 29, 1992), cause dism'd, 65 Ohio St. 3d 1453, 602 N. E. 2d 250 (1992).\n\n\n5\nRespondent then filed a second petition for state postconviction relief alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because his attorney did not argue that the State's failure to comply with its sentencing procedures violated the Eighth Amendment. The Ohio Court of Appeals in a conclusory opinion denied his claim, referring back to its previous decision. State v. Esparza, No. L-84-225, 1994 WL 395114, *5 (July 27, 1994), cause dism'd, 70 Ohio St. 3d 1473, 640 N. E. 2d 845 (1994). The import of the court's decision was clear: Respondent failed to prove he was prejudiced because any error committed by counsel was harmless. In respondent's words, \"The state court ... determined that since [respondent] was the only individual charged, the jury must have determined that [respondent] was the principal offender.\" Brief in Opposition 2.\n\n\n6\nHaving exhausted his avenues for relief under state law, respondent filed a habeas petition in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The District Court concluded that the Ohio Court of Appeals' decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law because it was contrary to our opinions in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993). In light of this error, as well as others not relevant to this opinion, the court granted respondent's petition in part and issued a writ of habeas corpus as to the death sentence. Esparza v. Anderson, No. 3:96-CV-7434 (Oct. 13, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-240a. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court, holding that the Eighth Amendment precluded respondent's death sentence and that harmless-error review was inappropriate. The State of Ohio petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we now grant, along with respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.\n\n\n7\nA federal court may grant a state habeas petitioner relief for a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court only if that adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d)(1). The Court of Appeals, however, failed to cite, much less apply, this section.\n\n\n8\nA state court's decision is \"contrary to\" our clearly established law if it \"applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases\" or if it \"confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.\" Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405-406 (2000); see also Price v. Vincent, 538 U. S. 634, 640 (2003); Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3, 7-8 (2002) (per curiam). A state court's decision is not \"contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law\" simply because the court did not cite our opinions. Id., at 8. We have held that a state court need not even be aware of our precedents, \"so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them.\" Ibid.\n\n\n9\nAccording to the Sixth Circuit, Ohio's failure to charge in the indictment that respondent was a \"principal\" was the functional equivalent of \"dispensing with the reasonable doubt requirement.\" 310 F. 3d, at 421 (citing Sullivan v. Louisiana, supra, at 280). Our precedents, however, do not support its conclusion. In noncapital cases, we have often held that the trial court's failure to instruct a jury on all of the statutory elements of an offense is subject to harmless-error analysis. E. g., Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 19 (1999); California v. Roy, 519 U. S. 2 (1996) (per curiam); Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263, 266 (1989) (per curiam); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987). In Neder, for example, we held that such an error \"differs markedly from the constitutional violations we have found to defy harmless-error review.\" 527 U. S., at 8. In so holding, we explicitly distinguished Sullivan because the error in Sullivan—the failure to instruct the jury that the State must prove the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt—\"`vitiat[ed] all the jury's findings,'\" 527 U. S., at 11, whereas the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on one element of an offense did not, see id., at 13-15. Where the jury was precluded from determining only one element of an offense, we held that harmless-error review is feasible. Ibid.\n\n\n10\nWe cannot say that because the violation occurred in the context of a capital sentencing proceeding that our precedent requires the opposite result. Indeed, a number of our harmless-error cases have involved capital defendants,2 Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991) (unconstitutional admission of coerced confession at guilt stage); Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990) (unconstitutionally broad jury instructions at sentencing stage); Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U. S. 249 (1988) (unconstitutional admission of evidence at sentencing stage), and we left a question similar to the one presented here open in another capital case, Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 609, n. 7 (2002) (\"We do not reach the State's assertion that any error was harmless because a pecuniary gain finding was implicit in the jury's guilty verdict\").\n\n\n11\nIn relying on the absence of precedent to distinguish our noncapital cases, and to hold that harmless-error review is not available for this type of Eighth Amendment claim, the Sixth Circuit exceeded its authority under § 2254(d)(1). A federal court may not overrule a state court for simply holding a view different from its own, when the precedent from this Court is, at best, ambiguous. As the Ohio Court of Appeals' decision does not conflict with the reasoning or the holdings of our precedent, it is not \"contrary to ... clearly established Federal law.\"\n\n\n12\nThe question then becomes whether the Ohio Court of Appeals' determination is an \"unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.\" § 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added; punctuation omitted). A constitutional error is harmless when \"it appears `beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.'\" Neder, supra, at 15 (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967)); see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 681 (1986). We may not grant respondent's habeas petition, however, if the state court simply erred in concluding that the State's errors were harmless; rather, habeas relief is appropriate only if the Ohio Court of Appeals applied harmless-error review in an \"objectively unreasonable\" manner. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 75-77 (2003); see also Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 25 (2002) (per curiam); Williams, supra, at 410 (An \"unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law\").\n\n\n13\nThe Ohio Court of Appeals' conclusion was hardly objectively unreasonable. The Ohio Supreme Court has defined a \"`principal offender'\" as \"`the actual killer,'\" State v. Chinn, 85 Ohio St. 3d 548, 559, 709 N. E. 2d 1166, 1177 (1999), and in this case, the jury was instructed on the elements of aggravated murder, \"`defined as purposely causing the death of another while committing Aggravated Robbery,'\" 310 F. 3d, at 432 (Suhrheinrich, J., dissenting). The trial judge further instructed the jury that it must determine \"`whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense of Aggravated Murder was committed while the Defendant was committing Aggravated Robbery.'\" Ibid. In light of these instructions, the jury verdict would surely have been the same had it been instructed to find as well that the respondent was a \"principal\" in the offense. After all, he was the only defendant charged in the indictment. There was no evidence presented that anyone other than respondent was involved in the crime or present at the store.3 Cf. Neder, 527 U. S., at 19 (\"[W]here a defendant did not, and apparently could not, bring forth facts contesting the omitted element, answering the question whether the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error does not fundamentally undermine the purposes of the jury trial guarantee\"). Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the state court's conclusion that respondent was convicted of a capital offense was objectively unreasonable. That being the case, we may not set aside its decision on habeas review.4\n\n\n14\nThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n15\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n1\n Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2929.04(A) (Anderson 2002) provides, in relevant part:\n\"Imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded, unless one or more of the following is specified in the indictment or count in the indictment ... and proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n. . . . .\n\"(7) The offense was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit ... aggravated robbery, . . . and either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.\"\n\n\n2\n The Sixth Circuit citedPresnell v. Georgia, 439 U.S. 14 (1978) (per curiam), a due process case, noting that rather than remand for a harmless-error analysis, we simply reversed. In Presnell, we held that the Georgia Supreme Court violated due process when it sustained a death sentence because the sentence was supported by the evidence, even though the defendant was unaware of the charge and the issue was never submitted to a jury. Presnell, however, relied on the defendant's lack of notice and his inability to defend himself, not a faulty indictment or an incomplete jury instruction.\n\n\n3\n The Court of Appeals noted evidence brought to light for the first time in the habeas proceeding in the District Court that suggested there might have been another participant in the crime, Joe Jasso. The jury, however, was not presented with this evidence at trial, and thus it has no bearing on the correctness of the Ohio Court of Appeals' decision that the State need not charge a defendant as a principal offender if the failure to so charge is harmless error\n\n\n4\n Our decision, like the Court of Appeals', is limited to the issue presented here. We express no view whether habeas relief would be available to respondent on other grounds\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied upon the \"substantial public interest in knowing to whom the government is directing information, or as ONDA characterizes it, \"propaganda,' so that those persons may receive information from other sources that do not share the BLM's self-interest in presenting government activities in the most favorable light. '' 83 F.3d 1168, 1171 (C.A.9 1996) (emphasis added). \"There is,'' the Court of Appeals said, \"a significant public interest in knowing with whom the government has chosen to communicate and in providing those persons with additional information .. . . '' Id., at 1172 (emphasis added).\n\n\n2\nThese statements, which are the sum total of the Court of Appeals' analysis of the public interest in disclosure, make clear that the court's judgment rested on a perceived public interest in \"providing [persons on the BLM's mailing list] with additional information.''

Nager argued the cause for petitioners in both cases. With him on the briefs for petitioner in No. 04-805 were Craig E. Stewart, Joe Sims, and Louis K. Fisher. On the briefs for petitioner in No. 04-814 were Ronald L. Olson, Bradley S. Phillips, Stuart N. Senator, and Paul J. Watford.\nJeffrey P. Minear argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae urging reversal in both cases. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Clement, Acting Assistant Attorney General Barnett, Deputy Solicitor General Hungar, Catherine G. O'Sullivan, and Adam D. Hirsh.\n*3 Joseph M. Alioto argued the cause for respondents in both cases. With him on the brief were Daniel R. Shulman and Gregory Merz.[]\nJUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\nFrom 1998 until 2002, petitioners Texaco Inc. and Shell Oil Co. collaborated in a joint venture, Equilon Enterprises, to refine and sell gasoline in the western United States under the original Texaco and Shell Oil brand names. Respondents, a class of Texaco and Shell Oil service station owners, allege that petitioners engaged in unlawful price fixing when Equilon set a single price for both Texaco and Shell Oil brand gasoline. We granted certiorari to determine whether it is per se illegal under § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S. C. § 1, for a lawful, economically integrated joint venture to set the prices at which the joint venture sells its products. We conclude that it is not, and accordingly we reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\nI\nHistorically, Texaco and Shell Oil have competed with one another in the national and international oil and gasoline *4 markets. Their business activities include refining crude oil into gasoline, as well as marketing gasoline to downstream purchasers, such as the service stations represented in respondents' class action.\nIn 1998, Texaco and Shell Oil formed a joint venture, Equilon, to consolidate their operations in the western United States, thereby ending competition between the two companies in the domestic refining and marketing of gasoline. Under the joint venture agreement, Texaco and Shell Oil agreed to pool their resources and share the risks of and profits from Equilon's activities. Equilon's board of directors would comprise representatives of Texaco and Shell Oil, and Equilon gasoline would be sold to downstream purchasers under the original Texaco and Shell Oil brand names. The formation of Equilon was approved by consent decree, subject to certain divestments and other modifications, by the Federal Trade Commission, see In re Shell Oil Co., 125 F. T. C. 769 (1998), as well as by the state attorneys general of California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington. Notably, the decrees imposed no restrictions on the pricing of Equilon gasoline.\nAfter the joint venture began to operate, respondents brought suit in District Court, alleging that, by unifying gasoline prices under the two brands, petitioners had violated the per se rule against price fixing that this Court has long recognized under § 1 of the Sherman Act, ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S. C. § 1. See, e. g., Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 647 (1980) (per curiam). The District Court awarded summary judgment to Texaco and Shell Oil. It determined that the rule of reason, rather than a per se rule or the quick look doctrine, governs respondents' claim, and that, by eschewing rule of reason analysis, respondents had failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The Ninth Circuit reversed, characterizing petitioners' position as a request for an \"exception to the per se prohibition on price-fixing,\" and rejecting that request. Dagher v. *5 Saudi Refining, Inc., 369 F.3d 1108, 1116 (2004). We consolidated Texaco's and Shell Oil's separate petitions and granted certiorari to determine the extent to which the per se rule against price fixing applies to an important and increasingly popular form of business organization, the joint venture. 545 U.S. 1138 (2005).\n\nII\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits \"[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States.\" 15 U.S. C. § 1. This Court has not taken a literal approach to this language, however. See, e. g., State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 10 (1997) (\"[T]his Court has long recognized that Congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints\" (emphasis added)). Instead, this Court presumptively applies rule of reason analysis, under which antitrust plaintiffs must demonstrate that a particular contract or combination is in fact unreasonable and anticompetitive before it will be found unlawful. See, e. g., id., at 10-19. Per se liability is reserved for only those agreements that are \"so plainly anti-competitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality.\" National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692 (1978). Accordingly, \"we have expressed reluctance to adopt per se rules ... `where the economic impact of certain practices is not immediately obvious.'\" State Oil, supra, at 10 (quoting FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458-459 (1986)).\nPrice-fixing agreements between two or more competitors, otherwise known as horizontal price-fixing agreements, fall into the category of arrangements that are per se unlawful. See, e. g., Catalano, supra, at 647. These cases do not present such an agreement, however, because Texaco and Shell Oil did not compete with one another in the relevant marketnamely, the sale of gasoline to service stations in the western United Statesbut instead participated in that *6 market jointly through their investments in Equilon.[1] In other words, the pricing policy challenged here amounts to little more than price setting by a single entityalbeit within the context of a joint ventureand not a pricing agreement between competing entities with respect to their competing products. Throughout Equilon's existence, Texaco and Shell Oil shared in the profits of Equilon's activities in their role as investors, not competitors. When \"persons who would otherwise be competitors pool their capital and share the risks of loss as well as the opportunities for profit ... such joint ventures [are] regarded as a single firm competing with other sellers in the market.\" Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U.S. 332, 356 (1982). As such, though Equilon's pricing policy may be price fixing in a literal sense, it is not price fixing in the antitrust sense. See Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 9 (1979) (\"When two partners set the price of their goods or services they are literally `price fixing,' but they are not per se in violation of the Sherman Act\").\nThis conclusion is confirmed by respondents' apparent concession that there would be no per se liability had Equilon simply chosen to sell its gasoline under a single brand. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34. We see no reason to treat Equilon differently just because it chose to sell gasoline under two distinct *7 brands at a single price. As a single entity, a joint venture, like any other firm, must have the discretion to determine the prices of the products that it sells, including the discretion to sell a product under two different brands at a single, unified price. If Equilon's price unification policy is anticompetitive, then respondents should have challenged it pursuant to the rule of reason.[2] But it would be inconsistent with this Court's antitrust precedents to condemn the internal pricing decisions of a legitimate joint venture as per se unlawful.[3]\nThe court below reached the opposite conclusion by invoking the ancillary restraints doctrine. 369 F.3d, at 1118-1124. That doctrine governs the validity of restrictions imposed by a legitimate business collaboration, such as a business association or joint venture, on nonventure activities. See, e. g., National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 113-115 (1984); Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States, 394 U.S. 131, 135-136 (1969). Under the doctrine, courts must determine whether the nonventure restriction is a naked restraint on trade, and thus invalid, or one that is ancillary to the legitimate and competitive purposes of the business association, and thus valid. We agree with petitioners that the ancillary restraints doctrine has no application here, where the business practice being challenged involves the core activity of the joint venture itselfnamely, the pricing of the very *8 goods produced and sold by Equilon. And even if we were to invoke the doctrine in these cases, Equilon's pricing policy is clearly ancillary to the sale of its own products. Judge Fernandez, dissenting from the ruling of the court below, put it well:\n\"In this case, nothing more radical is afoot than the fact that an entity, which now owns all of the production, transportation, research, storage, sales and distribution facilities for engaging in the gasoline business, also prices its own products. It decided to price them the same, as any other entity could. What could be more integral to the running of a business than setting a price for its goods and services?\" 369 F.3d, at 1127.\nSee also Broadcast Music, supra, at 23 (\"Joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements are ... not usually unlawful, at least not as price-fixing schemes, where the agreement on price is necessary to market the product at all\").\n\n* * *\nBecause the pricing decisions of a legitimate joint venture do not fall within the narrow category of activity that is per se unlawful under § 1 of the Sherman Act, respondents' anti-trust claim cannot prevail. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\nJUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\nNOTES\n[*]  Together with No. 04-814, Shell Oil Co. v.

Vaughn filed a brief for the Parker Hannifin Corp. as amicus curiae in No. 04-805.\n[1]  We presume for purposes of these cases that Equilon is a lawful joint venture. Its formation has been approved by federal and state regulators, and there is no contention here that it is a sham. As the court below noted: \"There is a voluminous record documenting the economic justifications for creating the joint ventures. [T]he defendants concluded that numerous synergies and cost efficiencies would result\" by creating Equilon as well as a parallel venture, Motiva Enterprises, in the eastern United States, and \"that nationwide there would be up to $800 million in cost savings annually.\" 369 F.3d 1108, 1111 (CA9 2004). Had respondents challenged Equilon itself, they would have been required to show that its creation was anticompetitive under the rule of reason. See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768 (1984).\n[2]  Respondents have not put forth a rule of reason claim. 369 F.3d, at 1113. Accordingly, we need not address petitioners' alternative argument that § 1 of the Sherman Act is inapplicable to joint ventures.\n[3]  Respondents alternatively contend that petitioners should be held liable under the quick look doctrine. To be sure, we have applied the quick look doctrine to business activities that are so plainly anticompetitive that courts need undertake only a cursory examination before imposing anti-trust liability. See California Dental Assn. v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 770 (1999). But for the same reasons that per se liability is unwarranted here, we conclude that petitioners cannot be held liable under the quick look doctrine.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

KOKKONEN, Petitionerv.GUARDIAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICASUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nNo. 93-263\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\nDecided: May 16, 1994.\n\nScalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAfter respondent Guardian Life Insurance Company*n1 terminated petitioner's general agency agreement, petitioner brought suit in California Superior Court alleging various state-law claims. Respondent removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California on the basis of diversity jurisdiction and filed state-law counterclaims. After closing arguments but before the District Judge instructed the jury, the parties arrived at an oral agreement settling all claims and counterclaims, the substance of which they recited, on the record, before the District Judge in chambers. In April 1992, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(ii), the parties executed a Stipulation and Order of Dismissal With Prejudice, dismissing the complaint and cross-complaint. On April 13, the District Judge signed the Stipulation and Order under the notation \"It is so ordered.\" The Stipulation and Order did not reserve jurisdiction in the District Court to enforce the settlement agreement; indeed, it did not so much as refer to the settlement agreement.\n\n\n2\nThereafter the parties disagreed on petitioner's obligation to return certain files to respondent under the settlement agreement. On May 21 respondent moved in the District Court to enforce the agreement, which petitioner opposed on the ground, inter alia, that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. The District Court entered an enforcement order, asserting an \"inherent power\" to do so. Order Enforcing Settlement, (ED Cal., Aug. 19, 1992), App. 180. Petitioner appealed, relying solely on his jurisdictional objection. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, quoting its opinion in Wilkinson v. FBI, 922 F.2d 555, 557 (CA9 1991), to the effect that after dismissal of an action pursuant to a settlement agreement, a \"'district court has jurisdiction to decide the [enforcement] motion[] under its inherent supervisory power.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-5 (Apr. 27, 1993) (unpublished), judgt. order reported at 993 F.2d 883 (1993) (final brackets in original). We granted certiorari, 510 U.S. (1993).\n\n\n3\nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute, see Willy v. Coastal Corp., 503 U.S. , (1992) (slip op., at 4-5); Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986), which is not to be expanded by judicial decree, American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U.S. 6 (1951). It is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, Turner v. President of Bank of North-America, 4 Dall. 8, 11 (1799), and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction, McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 (1936).\n\n\n4\nThe dismissal in this case issued pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(ii), which provides for dismissal \"by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action,\" and causes that dismissal to be with prejudice if (as here) the stipulation so specifies. Neither the Rule nor any provision of law provides for jurisdiction of the court over disputes arising out of an agreement that produces the stipulation. It must be emphasized that what respondent seeks in this case is enforcement of the settlement agreement, and not merely reopening of the dismissed suit by reason of breach of the agreement that was the basis for dismissal. Some Courts of Appeals have held that the latter can be obtained under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).*n2 See, e.g., Keeling v. Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Assn., 937 F.2d 408, 410 (CA9 1991); Fairfax Countywide Citizens Assn. v. Fairfax County, 571 F.2d 1299, 1302-1303 (CA4 1978). But see Sawka v. Healtheast, Inc., 989 F.2d 138, 140-141 (CA3 1993) (breach of settlement agreement insufficient reason to set dismissal aside on Rule 60(b)(6) grounds); Harman v. Pauley, 678 F.2d 479, 480-481 (CA4 1982) (Rule 60(b)(6) does not require vacating dismissal order whenever a settlement agreement has been breached). Enforcement of the settlement agreement, however, whether through award of damages or decree of specific performance, is more than just a continuation or renewal of the dismissed suit, and hence requires its own basis for jurisdiction.\n\n\n5\nRespondent relies upon the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction, which recognizes federal courts' jurisdiction over some matters (otherwise beyond their competence) that are incidental to other matters properly before them. Respondent appeals to our statement (quoting a then-current treatise on equity) in Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U.S. 93 (1904): \"A bill filed to continue a former litigation in the same court . . . to obtain and secure the fruits, benefits and advantages of the proceedings and judgment in a former suit in the same court by the same or additional parties . . . or to obtain any equitable relief in regard to, or connected with, or growing out of, any judgment or proceeding at law rendered in the same court, . . . is an ancillary suit.\" Id., at 113-114 (citing 1 C Bates, Federal Equity Procedure § 97 (1901)).\n\n\n6\nThe doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction can hardly be criticized for being overly rigid or precise, but we think it does not stretch so far as that statement suggests. The expansive language of Julian can be countered by (equally inaccurate) dicta in later cases that provide an excessively limited description of the doctrine. See, e.g., Fulton Nat. Bank of Atlanta v. Hozier, 267 U.S. 276, 280 (1925) (\"No controversy can be regarded as dependent or ancillary unless it has direct relation to property or assets actually or constructively drawn into the court's possession or control by the principal suit\"). The holding of Julian was not remotely as permissive as its language: jurisdiction was based upon the fact that the court, in a prior decree of foreclosure, had expressly reserved jurisdiction to adjudicate claims against the judicially conveyed property, and to retake and resell the property if claims it found valid were not paid. 193 U.S., at 109-112.\n\n\n7\nIt is to the holdings of our cases, rather than their dicta, that we must attend, and we find none of them that has, for purposes of asserting otherwise nonexistent federal jurisdiction, relied upon a relationship so tenuous as the breach of an agreement that produced the dismissal of an earlier federal suit. Generally speaking, we have asserted ancillary jurisdiction (in the very broad sense in which that term is sometimes used) for two separate, though sometimes related, purposes: (1) to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are, in varying respects and degrees, factually interdependent, see, e.g., Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., 417 U.S. 467, 469, n. 1 (1974); Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, 270 U.S. 593, 610 (1926); and (2) to enable a court to function successfully, that is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees, see, e.g., Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991) (power to compel payment of opposing party's attorney's fees as sanction for misconduct); United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812) (contempt power to maintain order during proceedings). See generally 13 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3523 (1984); cf. 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (1988 ed., Supp. IV).\n\n\n8\nNeither of these heads supports the present assertion of jurisdiction. As to the first, the facts underlying respondent's dismissed claim for breach of agency agreement and those underlying its claim for breach of settlement agreement have nothing to do with each other; it would neither be necessary nor even particularly efficient that they be adjudicated together. No case of ours asserts, nor do we think the concept of limited federal jurisdiction permits us to assert, ancillary jurisdiction over any agreement that has as part of its consideration the dismissal of a case before a federal court.\n\n\n9\nBut it is the second head of ancillary jurisdiction, relating to the court's power to protect its proceedings and vindicate its authority, that both courts in the present case appear to have relied upon, judging from their references to \"inherent power,\" see App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2 and A-5; App. 180. We think, however, that the power asked for here is quite remote from what courts require in order to perform their functions. We have recognized inherent authority to appoint counsel to investigate and prosecute violation of a court's order. Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U.S. 787 (1987). But the only order here was that the suit be dismissed, a disposition that is in no way flouted or imperiled by the alleged breach of the settlement agreement. The situation would be quite different if the parties' obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of dismissal -- either by separate provision (such as a provision \"retaining jurisdiction\" over the settlement agreement) or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order. In that event, a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order, and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist. That, however, was not the case here. The judge's mere awareness and approval of the terms of the settlement agreement do not suffice to make them part of his order.\n\n\n10\nThe short of the matter is this: The suit involves a claim for breach of a contract, part of the consideration for which was dismissal of an earlier federal suit. No federal statute makes that connection (if it constitutionally could) the basis for federal-court jurisdiction over the contract dispute. The facts to be determined with regard to such alleged breaches of contract are quite separate from the facts to be determined in the principal suit, and automatic jurisdiction over such contracts is in no way essential to the conduct of federal-court business. If the parties wish to provide for the court's enforcement of a dismissal-producing settlement agreement, they can seek to do so. When the dismissal is pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), which specifies that the action \"shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper,\" the parties' compliance with the terms of the settlement contract (or the court's \"retention of jurisdiction\" over the settlement contract) may, in the court's discretion, be one of the terms set forth in the order. Even when, as occurred here, the dismissal is pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) (which does not by its terms empower a District Court to attach conditions to the parties' stipulation of dismissal) we think the court is authorized to embody the settlement contract in its dismissal order (or, what has the same effect, retain jurisdiction over the settlement contract) if the parties agree. Absent such action, however, enforcement of the settlement agreement is for state courts, unless there is some independent basis for federal jurisdiction.\n\n\n11\nWe reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n12\nIt is so ordered.\n\nDisposition\n\n13\n993 F.2d 883, reversed and remanded.\n\n\n14\n________________________________________\n\nFootnotes\n\n15\n*n1 Guardian Life is the sole respondent.

Respondent signed a request for disposition of the detainer pursuant to IAD Article III and was returned to New York to face murder and robbery charges. Article III(a) provides, inter alia, that, upon such a request, the prisoner must be brought to trial within 180 days, \"provided that for good cause shown a , the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court a may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.\" Although respondent's counsel initially agreed to a trial date set beyond the 180-day period, respondent subsequently moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the IAD's time limit had expired. In denying the motion, the trial court concluded that defense counsel's explicit agreement to the trial date constituted a waiver or abandonment of respondent's IAD rights. After respondent was convicted of both charges, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, affirmed the trial court's refusal to dismiss for lack of a timely trial. The State Court of Appeals, however, reversed and ordered that the indictment be dismissed; counsel's agreement to a later trial date, it held, did not waive respondent's IAD speedy trial rights.\nHeld:  Defense counsel's agreement to a trial date outside the IAD period bars the defendant from seeking dismissal on the ground that trial did not occur within that period. This Court has articulated a general rule that presumes the availability of waiver, United States v. Mezzanatto, 513 U.S. 196, 200-201, and has recognized that the most basic rights of criminal defendants are subject to waiver, Peretz v. United States, 501 U.S. 923, 936. For certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver, but scheduling matters are plainly among those for which agreement by counsel generally controls. Requiring the defendant's express assent for routine and often repetitive scheduling determinations would consume time to no apparent purpose. The text of the IAD, by allowing the court to grant \"good-cause continuances\" when either \"prisoner or his counsel\" is present, contemplates that scheduling questions may be left to counsel. Art. III(a) (emphasis added). The Court rejects respondent's arguments for affirmance: (1) that the IAD's provision for \"good-cause continuances\" is the sole means for extending the time period; (2) that the defendant should not be allowed to waive the time limits given that they benefit not only the defendant but society generally; and (3) that waiver of the IAD's time limits can be effected only by an affirmative request for treatment contrary to, or inconsistent with, those limits.

Fort, and Joseph Tidwell, Petitioners,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 96-8732.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nArgued Feb. 23, 1998.\nDecided April 28, 1998.\n\n\nSyllabus\n*\n\nAt petitioners' trial under 21 U.S.C. §§841 and 846 for \"conspir[ing]'' to \"possess with intent to  . . .  distribute [mixtures containing two] controlled substance[s],'' namely, cocaine and cocaine base (i.e., \"crack''), the jury was instructed that the Government must prove that the conspiracy involved measurable amounts of \"cocaine or cocaine base.'' (Emphasis added.)  The jury returned a general verdict of guilty, and the District Judge imposed sentences based on his finding that each petitioner's illegal conduct involved both cocaine and  crack. Petitioners argued (for the first time) in the Seventh Circuit that their sentences were unlawful insofar as they were based upon crack, because the word \"or'' in the jury instruction  meant that the judge must assume that the conspiracy involved only cocaine, which is treated more leniently than crack by United States Sentencing Guidelines §2D1.1(c).  However, the court held that the judge need not assume that only cocaine was involved, pointing out that, because the Guidelines require the sentencing judge, not the jury, to determine both the kind and the amount of the drugs at issue in a drug conspiracy, the jury's belief about which drugs were involved-cocaine, crack, or both-was beside the point.\nHeld: Because the Guidelines instruct the judge in a case like this to determine both the amount and kind of controlled substances for which a defendant should be held accountable, and then to impose a sentence that varies depending upon those determinations, see, e.g., Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351, it is the judge who is required to determine whether the \"controlled substances'' at issue-and how much of them-consisted of cocaine, crack, or both.  That is what the judge did in this case, and the jury's beliefs about the conspiracy are irrelevant.  This Court need not, and does not, consider the merits of petitioners' claims that the drug statutes and the Constitution required the judge to assume that the jury convicted them of a conspiracy involving only cocaine.  Even if that were so, it would make no difference here.  The Guidelines instruct the judge to base a drug-conspiracy offender's sentence on his \"relevant conduct,'' §1B1.3, which includes both conduct that constitutes the \"offense of conviction,'' §1B1.3(a)(1), and conduct that is \"part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,'' 1B1.3(a)(2).  Thus, the judge below would have had to determine the total amount of drugs, whether they consisted of cocaine, crack, or both, and the total amount of each-regardless of whether he believed that petitioners' crack-related conduct was part of the  \"offense of conviction'' or \"part of the same course of conduct,  or common scheme or plan.''  The Guidelines sentencing range-on either belief-is identical.  Petitioners' statutory and constitutional claims could make a difference if they could argue that their sentences exceeded the statutory maximum for a cocaine-only conspiracy, or that their crack-related activities did not constitute part of the \"same course of conduct,'' etc., but the record indicates that such arguments could not succeed.   Their argument, made for the first time on appeal, that the judge might have made different factual findings had he known that the  law required him to assume the jury had found a cocaine-only conspiracy is unpersuasive. Pp. ____-____.\n105 F.3d 1179, affirmed.\nBREYER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nSteven Shobat, Chicago, IL, appointed by court, for petitioners.\nEdward C. DuMont, New York City, for respondent.\nJustice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe statutes at issue in this case make it a crime to \"conspir[e]'' to \"possess with intent to  . . .  distribute  . . .  a controlled substance.'' 21 U.S.C. §§841 and 846.  The Government charged petitioners with violating these statutes by conspiring \"to possess with intent to distribute  . . .  mixtures containing'' two controlled substances, namely \"cocaine  . . . and cocaine base'' (i.e., \"crack'').  App. 6.  The District Judge instructed the jury that \"the government must prove that the conspiracy  . . .  involved measurable amounts of cocaine or cocaine base.''  App. 16 (emphasis added).  The jury returned a general verdict of guilty.  And the judge imposed sentences based on his finding that each petitioner's illegal conduct had involved both cocaine and crack.\n\n\n2\nPetitioners argued (for the first time) in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit that the judge's sentences were unlawful insofar as they were based upon crack.  They said that the word \"or'' in the judge's instruction (permitting a guilty verdict if the conspiracy involved either cocaine or crack) meant that the judge must assume that the conspiracy involved only cocaine, which drug, they added, the Sentencing Guidelines treat more leniently than crack.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §2D1.1(c) (drug table) (Nov. 1994) (USSG).  The Court of Appeals, however, held that the judge need not assume that only cocaine was involved. 105 F.3d 1179 (1997). It pointed out that the Sentencing Guidelines require the sentencing judge, not the jury, to determine both the kind and the amount of the drugs at issue in a drug conspiracy. 105 F.3d,  at 1180.  And it reasoned that the jury's belief about which drugs were involved-cocaine, crack, or both-was therefore beside  the point. 105 F.3d, at 1181.  In light of a potential conflict among the circuits on this question, see, e.g., United States v. Bounds, 985 F.2d 188, 194-195 (C.A.5 1993); United States v. Pace, 981 F.2d 1123 (C.A.10 1992); United States v. Owens, 904 F.2d 411 (C.A.8 1990), we granted certiorari.\n\n\n3\nWe agree that in the circumstances of this case the judge was authorized to determine for sentencing purposes whether crack, as well as cocaine, was involved in the offense-related activities. The Sentencing Guidelines instruct the judge in a case like this one to determine both the amount and the kind of \"controlled substances'' for which a defendant should be held accountable-and then to impose a sentence that varies depending upon amount and kind.  See United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148,  117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997) (per curiam) (judge may consider drug charge of which offender has been acquitted by jury in determining Guidelines sentence); Witte v. United States, 515  U.S. 389, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (judge may impose higher Guidelines sentence on offender convicted of possessing marijuana based on judge's finding that offender also engaged in uncharged cocaine conspiracy).  Consequently, regardless of the jury's actual, or assumed, beliefs about the conspiracy, the Guidelines nonetheless require the judge to determine whether the \"controlled substances'' at issue-and how much of those substances-consisted of cocaine, crack, or both.  And that is what the judge did in this case.\n\n\n4\nVirtually conceding this Guidelines-related point, petitioners argue that the drug statutes, as well as the Constitution, required the judge to assume that the jury convicted them of a conspiracy involving only cocaine.  Petitioners misapprehend the significance of this contention, however, for even if they are correct, it would make no difference to their case.  That is because the Guidelines instruct a sentencing judge to base a drug-conspiracy offender's  sentence on the offender's \"relevant conduct.''  USSG §1B1.3.  And \"relevant conduct,'' in a case like this, includes both conduct that constitutes the \"offense of conviction,'' id., §1B1.3(a)(1), and conduct that is \"part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,'' id., §1B1.3(a)(2).  Thus, the sentencing judge here would have had to determine the total amount of drugs, determine whether the drugs consisted of cocaine, crack or both, and determine the total amount of each-regardless of whether the judge believed that petitioners' crack-related conduct was part of the \"offense  of conviction,'' or the judge believed that it was \"part of the same course of conduct, or common scheme or plan.''  The Guidelines sentencing range-on either belief-is identical.\n\n\n5\nOf course, petitioners' statutory and constitutional claims would make a difference if it were possible to argue, say, that the sentences imposed exceeded the maximum that the statutes permit for a cocaine-only conspiracy.  That is because a maximum sentence set by statute trumps a higher sentence set forth in the Guidelines.  USSG §5G1.1.  But, as the Government points out, the sentences imposed here were within the statutory limits applicable to a cocaine-only conspiracy, given the quantities of  that drug attributed to each petitioner.  Brief for United States 15-16, and nn. 6-7; see 21 U.S.C. §§841(b)(1)-(3); App. 42-47, 72-82, 107-112, 136-141, 163-169 (cocaine attributed to each petitioner). Cf. United States v. Orozco-Prada, 732 F.2d 1076, 1083-1084 (C.A.2 1984) (court may not sentence defendant under statutory penalties for cocaine conspiracy when jury may have found only marijuana conspiracy).  Petitioners' statutory and constitutional claims also could have made a difference had it been possible to argue that their crack-related activities did not constitute part of the \"same course of conduct, or common scheme, or plan.''  Then, of course, the crack (had it not been part of the \"offense of conviction'') would not have been part of the sentence-related \"relevant conduct'' at all.  But petitioners have not made this argument, and, after reviewing the record (which shows a series of interrelated drug transactions involving both cocaine and crack), we do not see how any such claim could succeed.\n\n\n6\nInstead, petitioners argue that the judge might have made different factual findings if only the judge had known that the law required him to assume the jury had found a cocaine-only, not a cocaine-and-crack, conspiracy.  It is sufficient for present purposes, however, to point out that petitioners did not make this particular argument in the District Court.  Indeed, they seem to have raised their entire argument for the first time in the Court of Appeals.  Thus, petitioners did not explain to the sentencing judge how their \"jury-found-only-cocaine'' assumption  could have made a difference to the judge's own findings, nor did they explain how this assumption (given the judge's findings) should lead to greater leniency.  Moreover, our own review of the record indicates that the judge's Guidelines-based fact-finding,  while resting upon the evidence before the jury, did not depend on any particular assumption about the type of conspiracy the jury found. Nor is there any indication that the assumption petitioners urge (a cocaine-only conspiracy) would likely have made a difference in respect to discretionary leniency.\n\n\n7\nFor these reasons, we need not, and we do not, consider the merits of petitioners' statutory and constitutional claims.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n8\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

As a result, he had served 2.5 years' too much prison time and was at once set free, but a 3-year term of supervised release was yet to be served on the remaining convictions. He filed a motion to reduce his supervised release term by the amount of extra prison time he served. The District Court denied relief, explaining that the supervised release commenced upon respondent's actual release from incarceration, not before. The Sixth Circuit reversed, accepting respondent's argument that his supervised release term commenced not on the day he left prison, but when his lawful term of imprisonment expired.\nHeld:  This Court is bound by the controlling statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e), which, by its necessary operation, does not reduce the length of a supervised release term by reason of excess time served in prison. Under §3624(e), a supervised release term does not commence until an individual \"is released from imprisonment.\" The ordinary, commonsense meaning of \"release\" is to be freed from confinement. To say respondent was released while still imprisoned diminishes the concept the word intends to convey. Section 3624(e) also provides that a supervised release term comes \"after imprisonment,\" once the prisoner is \"released by the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probation officer.\" Thus, supervised release does not run while an individual remains in the Bureau of Prisons' custody. The phrase \"on the day the person is released\" in §3624(e) suggests a strict temporal interpretation, not some fictitious or constructive earlier time. Indeed, the section admonishes that \"supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned.\" The statute does provide for concurrent running of supervised release in specific, identified cases, but the Court infers that Congress limited §3624(e) to the exceptions set forth. Finally, §3583(e)(3) does not have a substantial bearing on the interpretive issue, for this directive addresses instances where conditions of supervised release have been violated, and the court orders a revocation. While the text of §3624(e) resolves the case, the Court's conclusion accords with the objectives of supervised release, which include assisting individuals in their transition to community life. Supervised release fulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served by incarceration. The Court also observes that the statutory structure provides a means to address the equitable concerns that exist when an individual is incarcerated beyond the proper expiration of his prison term. The trial court, as it sees fit, may modify the individual's supervised release conditions, §3583(e)(2), or it may terminate his supervised release obligations after one year of completed service, §3583(e)(1).

As a result, he had served too much prison time and was at once set free, but a term of supervised release was yet to be served on the remaining convictions. The question becomes whether the excess prison time should be credited to the supervised release term, reducing its length. Bound by the text of the controlling statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e), we hold that the supervised release term remains unaltered.\n\n\n6\nRespondent Roy Lee Johnson was convicted in 1990 on two counts of possession with an intent to distribute controlled substances, 84 Stat. 1260, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a), on two counts of use of a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (1994 ed., and Supp. IV), and on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, §922(g). He received a sentence of 171 months' imprisonment, consisting of three concurrent 51-month terms on the §841(a) and §922(g) counts, to be followed by two consecutive 60-month terms on the §924(c) counts. In addition, the District Court imposed a mandatory 3-year term of supervised release for the drug possession offenses. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (1994 ed., Supp. III). The Court of Appeals, though otherwise affirming respondent's convictions and sentence, concluded the District Court erred in sentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment for the two §924(c) firearm offenses. United States v. Johnson, 25 F.3d 1335, 1337 1338 (CA6 1994) (en banc). On remand the District Court modified the prisoner's sentence to a term of 111 months.\n\n\n7\nAfter our decision in Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137 (1995), respondent filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate his §924(c) convictions, and the Government did not oppose. On May 2, 1996, the District Court vacated those convictions, modifying respondent's sentence to 51 months. He had already served more than that amount of time, so the District Court ordered his immediate release. His term of supervised release then went into effect. This dispute concerns its length.\n\n\n8\nIn June 1996, respondent filed a motion requesting the District Court to reduce his supervised release term by 2.5 years, the extra time served on the vacated §924(c) convictions. The District Court denied relief, explaining that pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e) the supervised release commenced upon respondent's actual release from incarceration, not before. Granting respondent credit, the court observed, would undermine Congress' aim of using supervised release to assist convicted felons in their transitions to community life.\n\n\n9\nA divided Court of Appeals reversed. 154 F.3d 569 (CA6 1998). The court accepted respondent's argument that his term of supervised release commenced not on the day he left prison confines but earlier, when his lawful term of imprisonment expired. Id., at 571. Awarding respondent credit for the extra time served, the court further concluded, would provide meaningful relief because supervised release, while serving rehabilitative purposes, is also \"punitive in nature.\" Ibid. Judge Gilman dissented, agreeing with the position of the District Court. Id., at 572 573.\n\n\n10\nThe Courts of Appeals have reached differing conclusions on the question presented. Compare United States v. Blake, 88 F.3d 824, 825 (CA9 1996) (supervised release commences on the date defendants \"should have been released, rather than on the dates of their actual release\"), with United States v. Jeanes, 150 F.3d 483, 485 (CA5 1998) (supervised release cannot run during any period of imprisonment); United States v. Joseph, 109 F.3d 34 (CA1 1997) (same); United States v. Douglas, 88 F.3d 533, 534 (CA8 1996) (same). We granted certiorari to resolve the question, 527 U.S. ___ (1999), and we now reverse.\n\n\n11\nSection 3583(a) of Title 18 authorizes, and in some instances mandates, sentencing courts to order supervised release terms following imprisonment. On the issue presented for review whether a term of supervised release begins on the date of actual release from incarceration or on an earlier date due to a mistaken interpretation of federal law the language of 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e) controls. The statute provides in relevant part:\n\n\n12\n\"A prisoner whose sentence includes a term of supervised release after imprisonment shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probation officer who shall, during the term imposed, supervise the person released to the degree warranted by the conditions specified by the sentencing court. The term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment and runs concurrently with any Federal, State, or local term of probation or supervised release or parole for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes subject during the term of supervised release. A term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days.\"\n\n\n13\nThe quoted language directs that a supervised release term does not commence until an individual \"is released from imprisonment.\" There can be little question about the meaning of the word \"release\" in the context of imprisonment. It means \"[t]o loosen or destroy the force of; to remove the obligation or effect of; hence to alleviate or remove;   [t]o let loose again; to set free from restraint, confinement, or servitude; to set at liberty; to let go.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 2103 (2d ed. 1949). As these definitions illustrate, the ordinary, commonsense meaning of release is to be freed from confinement. To say respondent was released while still imprisoned diminishes the concept the word intends to convey.\n\n\n14\nThe first sentence of §3624(e) supports our construction. A term of supervised release comes \"after imprisonment,\" once the prisoner is \"released by the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probation officer.\" Supervised release does not run while an individual remains in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. The phrase \"on the day the person is released,\" in the second sentence of §3624(e), suggests a strict temporal interpretation, not some fictitious or constructive earlier time. The statute does not say \"on the day the person is released or on the earlier day when he should have been released.\" Indeed, the third sentence admonishes that \"supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned.\"\n\n\n15\nThe statute does provide for concurrent running of supervised release in specific cases. After the operative phrase \"released from imprisonment,\" §3624(e) requires the concurrent running of a term of supervised release with terms of probation, parole, or with other, separate terms of supervised release. The statute instructs that concurrency is permitted not for prison sentences but only for those other types of sentences given specific mention. The next sentence in the statute does address a prison term and does allow concurrent counting, but only for prison terms less than 30 days in length. When Congress provides exceptions in a statute, it does not follow that courts have authority to create others. The proper inference, and the one we adopt here, is that Congress considered the issue of exceptions and, in the end, limited the statute to the ones set forth. The 30-day exception finds no application in this case; each of respondent's sentences, to which the term of supervised release attached, exceeded that amount of time. Finally, section 3583(e)(3) does not have a substantial bearing on the interpretive issue, for this directive addresses instances where conditions of supervised release have been violated, and the court orders a revocation.\n\n\n16\nOur conclusion finds further support in 18 U.S.C. § 3583(a), which authorizes the imposition of \"a term of supervised release after imprisonment.\" This provision, too, is inconsistent with respondent's contention that confinement and supervised release can run at the same time. The statute's direction is clear and precise. Release takes place on the day the prisoner in fact is freed from confinement.\n\n\n17\nThe Court of Appeals reasoned that reduction of respondent's supervised release term was a necessary implementation of §3624(a), which provides that \"[a] prisoner shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment   .\" All concede respondent's term of imprisonment should have ended earlier than it did. It does not follow, however, that the term of supervised release commenced, as a matter of law, once he completed serving his lawful sentences. It is true the prison term and the release term are related, for the latter cannot begin until the former expires. Though interrelated, the terms are not interchangeable. The Court of Appeals was mistaken in holding otherwise, and the text of §3624(e) cannot accommodate the rule the Court of Appeals derived. Supervised release has no statutory function until confinement ends. Cf. United States v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 50 (1994) (observing that \"terms of supervised release   follow up prison terms\"). The rule of lenity does not alter the analysis. Absent ambiguity, the rule of lenity is not applicable to guide statutory interpretation. Cf. Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 410 (1991).\n\n\n18\nWhile the text of §3624(e) resolves the case, we observe that our conclusion accords with the statute's purpose and design. The objectives of supervised release would be unfulfilled if excess prison time were to offset and reduce terms of supervised release. Congress intended supervised release to assist individuals in their transition to community life. Supervised release fulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served by incarceration. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D); United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §§5D1.3(c), (d), (e) (Nov. 1998); see also S. Rep. No. 98 225, p. 124 (1983) (declaring that \"the primary goal [of supervised release] is to ease the defendant's transition into the community after the service of a long prison term for a particularly serious offense, or to provide rehabilitation to a defendant who has spent a fairly short period in prison for punishment or other purposes but still needs supervision and training programs after release\"). Sentencing courts, in determining the conditions of a defendant's supervised release, are required to consider, among other factors, \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" \"the need   to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and to provide the defendant with needed education or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In the instant case, the transition assistance ordered by the trial court required respondent, among other conditions, to avoid possessing or transporting firearms and to participate in a drug dependency treatment program. These conditions illustrate that supervised release, unlike incarceration, provides individuals with postconfinement assistance. Cf. Gozlon-Peretz, supra, at 407 (describing \"[s]upervised release [a]s a unique method of post-confinement supervision invented by the Congress for a series of sentencing reforms\"). The Court of Appeals erred in treating respondent's time in prison as interchangeable with his term of supervised release.\n\n\n19\nThere can be no doubt that equitable considerations of great weight exist when an individual is incarcerated beyond the proper expiration of his prison term. The statutory structure provides a means to address these concerns in large part. The trial court, as it sees fit, may modify an individual's conditions of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(2). Furthermore, the court may terminate an individual's supervised release obligations \"at any time after the expiration of one year   if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant released and the interest of justice.\" §3583(e)(1). Respondentmay invoke §3583(e)(2) in pursuit of relief; and, having completed one year of supervised release, he may also seek relief under §3583(e)(1).\n\n\n20\nThe statute, by its own necessary operation, does not reduce the length of a supervised release term by reason of excess time served in prison. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n21\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, §6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993) (reprinted at Appendix A, infra). Each codefendant appealed to a different intermediate state court, one of which affirmed Fiore's conviction, the other of which reversed Scarpone's. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied further review of Fiore's case, and his conviction became final. However, that court agreed to review Scarpone's case, and it subsequently held that the statutory provision did not apply to those who, like Scarpone and Fiore, possessed a permit but deviated radically from the permit's terms. Consequently, it set aside Scarpone's conviction. In light of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Scarpone, Fiore asked the Pennsylvania courts to reconsider his identical conviction. They denied his request. He then broughta federal habeas corpus petition in which he argued, among other things, that Pennsylvania's courts, either as a matter of Pennsylvania law or as a matter of federal constitutional law, must apply the Scarpone interpretation of the statute to his identical case. If this proposition of law is correct, he asserted, it would follow that the Commonwealth failed to produce any evidence at all with respect to one essential element of the crime (namely, the lack of a permit). On this reasoning, Fiore concluded that the Federal Constitution requires his release. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 316 (1979); In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970).\n\n\n2\nThe Federal District Court granted the habeas petition, but the Court of Appeals reversed that decision. We agreed to review the appellate court's rejection of Fiore's claim. Before deciding whether the Federal Constitution requires that Fiore's conviction be set aside in light of Scarpone, we first must know whether Pennsylvania itself considers Scarpone to have explained what Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, §6018.401(a) always meant, or whether Pennsylvania considers Scarpone to have changed the law. We invoke the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's certification procedure in order to obtain that court's view of the matter. See Appendix B, infra.\n\n\n3\n* The relevant background circumstances include the following:\n\n\n4\n1.  Fiore owned and operated a hazardous waste disposal facility in Pennsylvania. Scarpone was the facility's general manager. Pennsylvania authorities, while conceding that Fiore and Scarpone possessed a permit to operate the facility, claimed that their deliberate alteration of a monitoring pipe to hide a leakage problem went so far beyond the terms of the permit that the operation took place without a permit at all. A jury convicted them both of having \"operate[d] a hazardous waste storage, treatment or disposal facility\" without a \"permit.\" Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, §6018.401(a); see Commonwealth v. Fiore, CC No. 8508740 (Ct. Common Pleas, Allegheny Cty., Pa., Jan. 19, 1988), p. 2, App. 6 (marking date of conviction as Feb. 18, 1986). The trial court upheld the conviction, despite the existence of a permit, for, in its view, the \"alterations of the   pipe represented such a significant departure from the terms of the existing permit that the operation of the hazardous waste facility was 'un-permitted' after the alterations were taken\" Id., at 48, App. 44.\n\n\n5\n2.  Fiore appealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §742 (1998) (granting the Superior Court jurisdiction over all appeals from a final order of a court of common pleas). That court affirmed the conviction \"on the basis of the opinion of the court below.\" Commonwealth v. Fiore, No. 00485 PGH 1988 (May 12, 1989), pp. 2 3, App. 99 100. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Fiore leave to appeal on March 13, 1990; shortly thereafter, Fiore's conviction became final.\n\n\n6\n3.  Fiore's codefendant, Scarpone, appealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §762(a)(2)(ii) (1998) (granting the Commonwealth Court jurisdiction over appeals in regulatory criminal cases). That court noted the existence of a \"valid permit,\" found the Commonwealth's interpretation of the statute \"strained at best,\" and set Scarpone's conviction aside. Scarpone v. Commonwealth, 141 Pa. Commw. 560, 567, 596 A. 2d 892, 895 (1991). The court wrote:\n\n\n7\n\"The alteration of the monitoring pipe was clearly a violation of the conditions of the permit. But to say that the alteration resulted in the operation of a new facility which had not been permitted is to engage in a semantic exercise which we cannot accept.   [W]e will not let [the provision's] language be stretched to include activities which clearly fall in some other subsection.\" Ibid.\n\n\n8\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the Commonwealth Court's conclusion.\n\nIt wrote:\n\n9\n\"[T]he Commonwealth did not make out the crime of operating a waste disposal facility without a permit   . Simply put, Mr. Scarpone did have a permit  . [T]o conclude that the alteration constituted the operation of a new facility without a permit is a bald fiction we cannot endorse  . The Commonwealth Court was right in reversing Mr. Scarpone's conviction of operating without a permit when the facility clearly had one.\" Commonwealth v. Scarpone, 535 Pa. 273, 279, 634 A. 2d 1109, 1112 (1993).\n\n\n10\n4.  Fiore again asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review his case, once after that court agreed to review Scarpone's case and twice more after it decided Scarpone. See Appellee's Supplemental App. in No. 97 3288 (CA3), pp. 59, 61 (including docket sheets reflecting Fiore's filings on Jan. 30, 1992, Jan. 24, 1994, and Oct. 18, 1994). The court denied those requests.\n\n\n11\n5.  Fiore then sought collateral relief in the state courts. The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pa., refused to grant Fiore's petition for collateral relief despite Scarpone because \"at the time of   conviction and direct appeals, the interpretation of the law was otherwise,\" and \"[t]he petitioner is not entitled to a retroactive application of the interpretation of the law set forth in Scarpone.\" Commonwealth v. Fiore, CC No. 8508740 (Aug. 18, 1994), p. 6. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed, both because Fiore had previously litigated the claim and because Fiore's \"direct appeal was no longer pending when the Supreme Court made the ruling which [Fiore] now seeks to have applied to his case.\" Commonwealth v. Fiore, 445 Pa. Super. 401, 416, 665 A. 2d 1185, 1193 (1995).\n\n\n12\n6.  Fiore sought federal habeas corpus relief. As we previously pointed out, supra, at 1 2, he argued that Pennsylvania had imprisoned him \"for conduct which was not criminal under the statutory section charged.\" App. 194. The Federal District Court, acting on a Magistrate's recommendation, granted the petition. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, however, primarily because it believed that \"state courts are under no constitutional obligation to apply their decisions retroactively.\" 149 F.3d 221, 222 (1998).\n\n\n13\n7.  We subsequently granted Fiore's petition for certiorari to consider whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause requires that his conviction be set aside.\n\nII\n\n14\nFiore essentially claims that Pennsylvania produced no evidence whatsoever of one element of the crime, namely that he lacked \"a permit.\" The validity of his federal claim may depend upon whether the interpretation of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Scarpone was always the statute's meaning, even at the time of Fiore's trial. Scarpone marked the first time the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had interpreted the statute; previously, Pennsylvania's lower courts had been divided in their interpretation. Fiore's and Scarpone's trial court concluded that §6018.401(a)'s \"permit\" requirement prohibited the operation of a hazardous waste facility in a manner that deviates from the permit's terms, and the Superior Court, in adjudicating Fiore's direct appeal, accepted the trial court's interpretation in a summary unpublished memorandum. Then, the Commonwealth Court, in Scarpone's direct appeal, specifically rejected the interpretation adopted by the Superior Court in Fiore's case. And the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Scarpone set forth its authoritative interpretation of the statute, affirming the Commonwealth Court only after Fiore's conviction became final. For that reason, we must know whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's construction of the statute in Scarpone stated the correct understanding of the statute at the time Fiore's conviction became final, or whether it changed the interpretation then applicable. Compare, e.g., Buradus v. General Cement Prods. Co., 52 A. 2d 205, 208 (Pa. 1947) (stating that \"[i]n general, the construction placed upon a statute by the courts becomes a part of the act, from the very beginning\" ) with Commonwealth v. Fiore, supra, at 416 417, 665 A. 2d, at 1193; Commonwealth v. Fiore, CC No. 8508740 (Aug. 18, 1994), at 6 (refusing to apply the Scarpone interpretation because \"at the time of [Fiore's] conviction and direct appeals, the interpretation of the law was otherwise\").\n\nIII\n\n15\nWe certify the following question to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court pursuant to that court's Rules Regarding Certification of Questions of Pennsylvania law:\n\n\n16\nDoes the interpretation of Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, §6018.401(a) (Purdon 1993), set forth in Scarpone v.

Days, III, Sol. Gen., Jo Ann Harris, Asst. Atty. Gen., Michael R. Dreeben, Acting Deputy Sol. Gen., Miguel A. Estrada, Asst. to the Sol. Gen., Dept. of Justice, Washington, DC, for petitioner.\nGlenn Stewart Warren (Appointed by this Court), San Diego, CA, for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nRespondent, Juan Paul Robertson, was charged with various narcotics offenses, and with violating § 1962(a) of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V), by investing the proceeds of those unlawful activities in the \"acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\"  18 U.S.C. § 1962(a).  He was convicted on some of the narcotics counts, and on the RICO count by reason of his investment in a certain gold mine.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the RICO conviction on the ground that the Government had failed to introduce sufficient evidence proving that the gold mine was \"engaged in or affect[ed] interstate commerce\".  15 F.3d 862, 868 (1994).  We granted the United States' petition for certiorari.  513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 354, 130 L.Ed.2d 309 (1994).\n\n\n2\nThe facts relevant to the \"engaged in or affecting interstate commerce\" issue were as follows:  Some time in 1985, Robertson entered into a partnership agreement with another man, whereby he agreed to finance a goldmining operation in Alaska.  In fulfillment of this obligation, Robertson, who resided in Arizona, made a cash payment of $125,000 for placer gold mining claims near Fairbanks.  He paid approximately $100,000 (in cash) for mining equipment and supplies, some of which were purchased in Los Angeles and transported to Alaska for use in the mine.  Robertson also hired and paid the expenses for seven out-of-state employees to travel to Alaska to work in the mine.  The partnership dissolved during the first mining season, but Robertson continued to operate the mine through 1987 as a sole proprietorship.  He again hired a number of employees from outside Alaska to work in the mine.  During its operating life, the mine produced between $200,000 and $290,000 worth of gold, most of which was sold to refiners within Alaska, although Robertson personally transported approximately $30,000 worth of gold out of the State.\n\n\n3\nMost of the parties' arguments, here and in the Ninth Circuit, were addressed to the question whether the activities of the gold mine \"affected\" interstate commerce.  We have concluded we do not have to consider that point.  The \"affecting commerce\" test was developed in our jurisprudence to define the extent of Congress's power over purely intrastate commercial activities that nonetheless have substantial interstate effects.  See, e.g., Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942).  The proof at Robertson's trial, however, focused largely on the interstate activities of Robertson's mine.  For example, the Government proved that Robertson purchased at least $100,000 worth of equipment and supplies for use in the mine.  Contrary to the Court of Appeals' suggestion, all of those items were not purchased locally (\"drawn generally from the stream of interstate commerce,\" 15 F.3d, at 869 (internal quotation marks omitted)); the Government proved that some of them were purchased in California and transported to Alaska for use in the mine's operations.  Cf. United States v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422 U.S. 271, 285, 95 S.Ct. 2150, 2159, 45 L.Ed.2d 177 (1975) (allegation that company had made local purchases of equipment and supplies that were merely manufactured out of state was insufficient to show that company was \"engaged in commerce\" within the meaning of § 7 of the Clayton Act).  The Government also proved that, on more than one occasion, Robertson sought workers from out of state and brought them to Alaska to work in the mine.  Cf. id., at 274, 95 S.Ct., at 2153.  Furthermore, Robertson, the mine's sole proprietor, took $30,000 worth of gold, or 15% of the mine's total output, with him out of the State.\n\n\n4\nWhether or not these activities met (and whether or not, to bring the gold mine within the \"affecting commerce\" provision of RICO, they would have to meet) the requirement of substantially affecting interstate commerce, they assuredly brought the gold mine within § 1962(a)'s alternative criterion of \"any enterprise . . . engaged in . . . interstate or foreign commerce.\"  As we said in American Building Maintenance, a corporation is generally \"engaged 'in commerce' \" when it is itself \"directly engaged in the production, distribution, or acquisition of goods and services in interstate commerce.\"  Id., at 283, 95 S.Ct., at 2158.

Copp Paving Co., Inc., 419 U.S. 186, 195, 95 S.Ct. 392, 398, 42 L.Ed.2d 378 (1974).\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n5\n\nReversed.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

THOMPSON, Warden, et al.\nNo. A-877 (91-8336).\nMay 20, 1992.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nAs the District Court below observed, this is now the twelfth round of judicial review in a murder case which began eleven years ago.  Yet despite having had eleven years to produce exculpatory evidence, Coleman has produced what, in the words of the District Court, does not even amount to a \"colorable claim of innocence.\" District Court opinion at 19.  We are hardly well-positioned to second guess the District Court's factual conclusion—we certainly have no basis for concluding that Coleman has produced \"substantial evidence that he may be innocent.\"  Post, at 189 (emphasis added).  Indeed, a good deal of Coleman's effort in this latest round is devoted to an attempt to undermine an expert's genetic analysis that further implicated him in the crime—an analysis conducted after trial at Coleman's request under the supervision of the Commonwealth's courts.\n\n\n2\nContrary to the dissent's characterization, Coleman's claim is far from \"substantially identical\" to that of Leonel Herrera, see Herrera v. Collins, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1074, 117 L.Ed.2d 279 (cert. granted, Feb. 19, 1992).  In Herrera the District Court concluded that the evidence of innocence warranted further inquiry. See 954 F.2d 1029 (CA5 1992).  Here, in contrast, the District Court reviewed Coleman's claim of innocence and rejected it on the merits.\n\n\n3\nThe application for stay of execution presented to the Chief Justice and by him referred to the full Court is denied.\n\n\n4\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n5\nJustice STEVENS concurs in the denial of a stay and would deny the petition for writ of certiorari.\n\n\n6\nJustice BLACKMUN, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nLast Term the Court ruled that Roger Coleman could not present his arguments on the merits to the federal courts, simply because the person then acting as his attorney had made a trivial error in filing his notice of appeal three days late.  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). While I dissented from that ruling—and still believe it was erroneous—I found some consolation in the Court's suggestion that matters might have been different had Coleman argued that he was actually innocent of the crime.  See id., at 501 U.S., at ---- - ----, ----, 111 S.Ct., at ---- - ----, ----.\n\n\n8\nColeman has now produced substantial evidence that he may be innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced to die.  Yet the Court once again turns him away, this time permitting the Commonwealth of Virginia to execute him without a hearing at which his evidence could be fully presented.  The Court's ruling is all the more troubling for me, in view of this Court's decision to hear argument next Term in a case in which the petitioner contends, just as Coleman does, that evidence of his innocence entitles him to a hearing on the merits.  Herrera v. Collins, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1074, 117 L.Ed.2d 279 (1992).\n\n\n9\nI have previously voted to stay an execution pending this Court's decision next Term in Herrera.  See Ellis v. Texas, 503 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1285, 117 L.Ed.2d 509 (1992);  Ellis v. Collins, 503 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1285, 117 L.Ed.2d 510 (1992).  I cannot believe that Coleman, who raises a substantially identical claim, should be denied all possibility of relief simply because his petition reached this Court later than did Leonel Herrera's. Accordingly, I would stay the execution.\n\n\n10\nJustice SOUTER would grant the application for stay of execution.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

NATHANIEL SMITH\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                  COURT OF ARKANSAS\n\n                No. 16–992.    Decided June 26, 2017\n\n\n   PER CURIAM. \n\n   As this Court explained in Obergefell v. Hodges, 576\n\nU. S. ___ (2015), the Constitution entitles same-sex cou-\nples to civil marriage “on the same terms and conditions\nas opposite-sex couples.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 23). In the\ndecision below, the Arkansas Supreme Court considered\nthe effect of that holding on the State’s rules governing the\nissuance of birth certificates. When a married woman\ngives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the\nname of the mother’s male spouse to appear on the child’s\nbirth certificate—regardless of his biological relationship\nto the child. According to the court below, however, Ar-\nkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated\nsame-sex couples: The State need not, in other words,\nissue birth certificates including the female spouses of\nwomen who give birth in the State. Because that differen-\ntial treatment infringes Obergefell’s commitment to pro-\nvide same-sex couples “the constellation of benefits that\nthe States have linked to marriage,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 17),\nwe reverse the state court’s judgment.\n   The petitioners here are two married same-sex couples\nwho conceived children through anonymous sperm dona-\ntion. Leigh and Jana Jacobs were married in Iowa in\n2010, and Terrah and Marisa Pavan were married in New\nHampshire in 2011. Leigh and Terrah each gave birth to\na child in Arkansas in 2015. When it came time to secure\nbirth certificates for the newborns, each couple filled out\npaperwork listing both spouses as parents—Leigh and\nJana in one case, Terrah and Marisa in the other. Both\n2                     PAVAN v. SMITH\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ntimes, however, the Arkansas Department of Health\nissued certificates bearing only the birth mother’s name.\n   The department’s decision rested on a provision of Ar-\nkansas law, Ark. Code §20–18–401 (2014), that specifies\nwhich individuals will appear as parents on a child’s state-\nissued birth certificate. “For the purposes of birth regis-\ntration,” that statute says, “the mother is deemed to be the\nwoman who gives birth to the child.” §20–18–401(e). And\n“[i]f the mother was married at the time of either concep-\ntion or birth,” the statute instructs that “the name of [her]\nhusband shall be entered on the certificate as the father of\nthe child.” §20–18–401(f)(1). There are some limited\nexceptions to the latter rule—for example, another man\nmay appear on the birth certificate if the “mother” and\n“husband” and “putative father” all file affidavits vouching\nfor the putative father’s paternity. Ibid. But as all parties\nagree, the requirement that a married woman’s husband\nappear on her child’s birth certificate applies in cases\nwhere the couple conceived by means of artificial insemi-\nnation with the help of an anonymous sperm donor. See\nPet. for Cert. 4; Brief in Opposition 3–4; see also Ark.\nCode §9–10–201(a) (2015) (“Any child born to a married\nwoman by means of artificial insemination shall be\ndeemed the legitimate natural child of the woman and the\nwoman’s husband if the husband consents in writing to\nthe artificial insemination”).\n   The Jacobses and Pavans brought this suit in Arkansas\nstate court against the director of the Arkansas Depart-\nment of Health—seeking, among other things, a declara-\ntion that the State’s birth-certificate law violates the\nConstitution. The trial court agreed, holding that the\nrelevant portions of §20–18–401 are inconsistent with\nObergefell because they “categorically prohibi[t] every\nsame-sex married couple . . . from enjoying the same\nspousal benefits which are available to every opposite-sex\nmarried couple.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a. But a divided\n                  Cite as: 582 U. S. ____ (2017)            3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nArkansas Supreme Court reversed that judgment, con-\ncluding that the statute “pass[es] constitutional muster.”\n2016 Ark. 437, 505 S.W.3d 169, 177. In that court’s view,\n“the statute centers on the relationship of the biological\nmother and the biological father to the child, not on the\nmarital relationship of husband and wife,” and so it “does\nnot run afoul of Obergefell.” Id., at 178. Two justices\ndissented from that view, maintaining that under Oberge-\nfell “a same-sex married couple is entitled to a birth certif-\nicate on the same basis as an opposite-sex married\ncouple.” 505 S.W.3d, at 184 (Brill, C. J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part); accord, id., at 190 (Danielson,\nJ., dissenting).\n   The Arkansas Supreme Court’s decision, we conclude,\ndenied married same-sex couples access to the “constella-\ntion of benefits that the Stat[e] ha[s] linked to marriage.”\nObergefell, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). As already\nexplained, when a married woman in Arkansas conceives\na child by means of artificial insemination, the State\nwill—indeed, must—list the name of her male spouse on\nthe child’s birth certificate. See §20–18–401(f )(1); see also\n§9–10–201; supra, at 2. And yet state law, as interpreted\nby the court below, allows Arkansas officials in those very\nsame circumstances to omit a married woman’s female\nspouse from her child’s birth certificate. See 505 S.W.3d,\nat 177–178. As a result, same-sex parents in Arkansas\nlack the same right as opposite-sex parents to be listed on\na child’s birth certificate, a document often used for im-\nportant transactions like making medical decisions for a\nchild or enrolling a child in school. See Pet. for Cert. 5–7\n(listing situations in which a parent might be required to\npresent a child’s birth certificate).\n   Obergefell proscribes such disparate treatment. As we\nexplained there, a State may not “exclude same-sex\ncouples from civil marriage on the same terms and condi-\ntions as opposite-sex couples.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\n4                          PAVAN v. SMITH\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nat 23). Indeed, in listing those terms and conditions—the\n“rights, benefits, and responsibilities” to which same-sex\ncouples, no less than opposite-sex couples, must have\naccess—we expressly identified “birth and death certifi-\ncates.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17). That was no accident:\nSeveral of the plaintiffs in Obergefell challenged a State’s\nrefusal to recognize their same-sex spouses on their chil-\ndren’s birth certificates. See DeBoer v. Snyder, 772 F.3d\n388, 398–399 (CA6 2014). In considering those challenges,\nwe held the relevant state laws unconstitutional to the\nextent they treated same-sex couples differently from\nopposite-sex couples. See 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 23).\nThat holding applies with equal force to §20–18–401.\n   Echoing the court below, the State defends its birth-\ncertificate law on the ground that being named on a child’s\nbirth certificate is not a benefit that attends marriage.\nInstead, the State insists, a birth certificate is simply a\ndevice for recording biological parentage—regardless of\nwhether the child’s parents are married. But Arkansas\nlaw makes birth certificates about more than just genetics.\nAs already discussed, when an opposite-sex couple con-\nceives a child by way of anonymous sperm donation—just\nas the petitioners did here—state law requires the place-\nment of the birth mother’s husband on the child’s birth\ncertificate. See supra, at 2. And that is so even though (as\nthe State concedes) the husband “is definitively not the\nbiological father” in those circumstances. Brief in Opposi-\ntion 4.* Arkansas has thus chosen to make its birth certif-\n——————\n  * As the petitioners point out, other factual scenarios (beyond those\npresent in this case) similarly show that the State’s birth certificates\nare about more than genetic parentage. For example, when an Arkan-\nsas child is adopted, the State places the child’s original birth certifi-\ncate under seal and issues a new birth certificate—unidentifiable as an\namended version—listing the child’s (nonbiological) adoptive parents.\nSee Ark. Code §§20–18–406(a)(1), (b) (2014); Ark. Admin. Code\n007.12.1–5.5(a) (Apr. 2016).\n                  Cite as: 582 U.

Having made that choice, Arkansas may not,\nconsistent with Obergefell, deny married same-sex couples\nthat recognition.\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and the pending\nmotions for leave to file briefs as amici curiae are granted.\nThe judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 582 U.

Decided June 26, 2017\n\n\n   JUSTICE GORSUCH, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and\nJUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.\n   Summary reversal is usually reserved for cases where\n“the law is settled and stable, the facts are not in dispute,\nand the decision below is clearly in error.” Schweiker v.\nHansen, 450 U.S. 785, 791 (1981) (Marshall, J., dissent-\ning). Respectfully, I don’t believe this case meets that\nstandard.\n   To be sure, Obergefell addressed the question whether a\nState must recognize same-sex marriages. But nothing in\nObergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question whether\n§20–18–401 of the Arkansas Code, or a state supreme\ncourt decision upholding it, must go. The statute in ques-\ntion establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the\nbiological parents of a child are listed on the child’s birth\ncertificate. Before the state supreme court, the State\nargued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth\nregistration regime, reasons that in no way offend Oberge-\nfell—like ensuring government officials can identify public\nhealth trends and helping individuals determine their\nbiological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic\ndisorders. In an opinion that did not in any way seek to\ndefy but rather earnestly engage Obergefell, the state\nsupreme court agreed. And it is very hard to see what is\nwrong with this conclusion for, just as the state court\nrecognized, nothing in Obergefell indicates that a birth\nregistration regime based on biology, one no doubt with\n2                      PAVAN v. SMITH\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nmany analogues across the country and throughout his-\ntory, offends the Constitution. To the contrary, to the\nextent they speak to the question at all, this Court’s prec-\nedents suggest just the opposite conclusion. See, e.g.,\nMichael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 124–125 (1989);\nTuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 73 (2001). Neither\ndoes anything in today’s opinion purport to identify any\nconstitutional problem with a biology based birth registra-\ntion regime. So whatever else we might do with this case,\nsummary reversal would not exactly seem the obvious\ncourse.\n   What, then, is at work here? If there isn’t a problem\nwith a biology based birth registration regime, perhaps\nthe concern lies in this particular regime’s exceptions. For\nit turns out that Arkansas’s general rule of registration\nbased on biology does admit of certain more specific excep-\ntions. Most importantly for our purposes, the State\nacknowledges that §9–10–201 of the Arkansas Code con-\ntrols how birth certificates are completed in cases of artifi-\ncial insemination like the one before us. The State\nacknowledges, too, that this provision, written some time\nago, indicates that the mother’s husband generally shall\nbe treated as the father—and in this way seemingly antic-\nipates only opposite-sex marital unions.\n   But if the artificial insemination statute is the concern,\nit’s still hard to see how summary reversal should follow\nfor at least a few reasons. First, petitioners didn’t actually\nchallenge §9–10–201 in their lawsuit. Instead, petitioners\nsought and the trial court granted relief eliminating the\nState’s authority under §20–18–401 to enforce a birth\nregistration regime generally based on biology. On appeal,\nthe state supreme court simply held that this overbroad\nremedy wasn’t commanded by Obergefell or the Constitu-\ntion. And, again, nothing in today’s opinion for the Court\nidentifies anything wrong, let alone clearly wrong, in that\nconclusion. Second, though petitioners’ lawsuit didn’t\n                 Cite as: 582 U. S. ____ (2017)            3\n\n                    GORSUCH, J., dissenting\n\nchallenge §9–10–201, the State has repeatedly conceded\nthat the benefits afforded nonbiological parents under §9–\n10–201 must be afforded equally to both same-sex and\nopposite-sex couples. So that in this particular case and\nall others of its kind, the State agrees, the female spouse\nof the birth mother must be listed on birth certificates too.\nThird, further proof still of the state of the law in Arkan-\nsas today is the fact that, when it comes to adoption (a\nsituation not present in this case but another one in which\nArkansas departs from biology based registration), the\nState tells us that adopting parents are eligible for\nplacement on birth certificates without respect to sexual\norientation.\n   Given all this, it seems far from clear what here war-\nrants the strong medicine of summary reversal. Indeed, it\nis not even clear what the Court expects to happen on\nremand that hasn’t happened already. The Court does not\noffer any remedial suggestion, and none leaps to mind.\nPerhaps the state supreme court could memorialize the\nState’s concession on §9–10–201, even though that law\nwasn’t fairly challenged and such a chore is hardly the\nusual reward for seeking faithfully to apply, not evade,\nthis Court’s mandates.\n   I respectfully dissent.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

ARIZONA\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                  COURT OF ARIZONA\n\n              No. 15–8366. Decided May 31, 2016\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Under Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994),\nand its progeny, “where a capital defendant’s future dan-\ngerousness is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative\nto death available to the jury is life imprisonment without\npossibility of parole,” the Due Process Clause “entitles the\ndefendant ‘to inform the jury of [his] parole ineligibility,\neither by a jury instruction or in arguments by counsel.’ ”\nShafer v. South Carolina, 532 U.S. 36, 39 (2001) (quoting\nRamdass v. Angelone, 530 U.S. 156, 165 (2000) (plurality\nopinion)). In the decision below, the Arizona Supreme\nCourt found that the State had put petitioner Shawn\nPatrick Lynch’s future dangerousness at issue during his\ncapital sentencing proceeding and acknowledged that\nLynch’s only alternative sentence to death was life impris-\nonment without parole. 238 Ariz. 84, 103, 357 P.3d 119,\n138 (2015). But the court nonetheless concluded that\nLynch had no right to inform the jury of his parole ineligi-\nbility. Ibid. The judgment is reversed.\n  A jury convicted Lynch of first-degree murder, kidnap-\nping, armed robbery, and burglary for the 2001 killing of\nJames Panzarella. The State sought the death penalty.\nBefore Lynch’s penalty phase trial began, Arizona moved\nto prevent his counsel from informing the jury that the\nonly alternative sentence to death was life without the\npossibility of parole. App. K to Pet. for Cert. The court\ngranted the motion.\n  Lynch’s first penalty phase jury failed to reach a unan-\nimous verdict. A second jury was convened and sentenced\n2                    LYNCH v. ARIZONA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nLynch to death. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court\nvacated the sentence because the jury instructions im-\nproperly described Arizona law. The court did not address\nLynch’s alternative argument that the trial court had\nviolated Simmons. On remand, a third penalty phase jury\nsentenced Lynch to death.\n   The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed, this time consid-\nering and rejecting Lynch’s Simmons claim. The court\nagreed that, during the third penalty phase, “[t]he State\nsuggested . . . that Lynch could be dangerous.” 238 Ariz.,\nat 103, 357 P. 3d, at 138. The court also recognized that\nLynch was parole ineligible: Under Arizona law, “parole is\navailable only to individuals who committed a felony\nbefore January 1, 1994,” and Lynch committed his crimes\nin 2001.      Ibid. (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §41–\n1604.09(I)). Nevertheless, while “[a]n instruction that\nparole is not currently available would be correct,” the\ncourt held that “the failure to give the Simmons instruc-\ntion was not error.” 238 Ariz., at 103, 357 P.3d, at 138.\n   That conclusion conflicts with this Court’s precedents.\nIn Simmons, as here, a capital defendant was ineligible for\nparole under state law. 512 U.S., at 156 (plurality opin-\nion). During the penalty phase, the State argued that the\njurors should consider the defendant’s future dangerous-\nness when determining the proper punishment. Id., at\n157. But the trial court refused to permit defense counsel\nto tell the jury that the only alternative sentence to death\nwas life without parole. Id., at 157, 160. The Court re-\nversed, reasoning that due process entitled the defendant\nto rebut the prosecution’s argument that he posed a future\ndanger by informing his sentencing jury that he is parole\nineligible. Id., at 161–162; id., at 178 (O’Connor, J., con-\ncurring in judgment). The Court’s opinions reiterated that\nholding in Ramdass, Shafer, and Kelly v. South Carolina,\n534 U.S. 246 (2002).\n   The Arizona Supreme Court thought Arizona’s sentenc-\n                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ning law sufficiently different from the others this Court\nhad considered that Simmons did not apply. It relied on\nthe fact that, under state law, Lynch could have received a\nlife sentence that would have made him eligible for “re-\nlease” after 25 years. 238 Ariz., at 103–104, 357 P. 3d, at\n138–139; §13–751(A). But under state law, the only kind\nof release for which Lynch would have been eligible—as\nthe State does not contest—is executive clemency. See\nPet. for Cert. 22; 238 Ariz., at 103–104, 357 P.3d, at 138–\n139. And Simmons expressly rejected the argument that\nthe possibility of clemency diminishes a capital defend-\nant’s right to inform a jury of his parole ineligibility.\nThere, South Carolina had argued that the defendant need\nnot be allowed to present this information to the jury\n“because future exigencies,” including “commutation [and]\nclemency,” could one day “allow [him] to be released into\nsociety.” 512 U.S., at 166 (plurality opinion). The Court\ndisagreed: “To the extent that the State opposes even a\nsimple parole-ineligibility instruction because of hypothet-\nical future developments, the argument has little force.”\nIbid.; id., at 177 (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (explaining that\nthe defendant had a right “to bring his parole ineligibility\nto the jury’s attention” and that the State could respond\nwith “truthful information regarding the availability of\ncommutation, pardon, and the like”).\n   The State responds that Simmons “ ‘applies only to\ninstances where, as a legal matter, there is no possibility\nof parole.’ ” Brief in Opposition 11 (quoting Ramdass, 530\nU.S., at 169 (plurality opinion)). Notwithstanding the fact\nthat Arizona law currently prevents all felons who com-\nmitted their offenses after 1993 from obtaining parole, 238\nAriz., at 103, 357 P.3d, at 138, Arizona reasons that\n“nothing prevents the legislature from creating a parole\nsystem in the future for which [Lynch] would have been\neligible had the court sentenced him to life with the possi-\nbility of release after 25 years.” Brief in Opposition 12.\n4                    LYNCH v. ARIZONA\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   This Court’s precedents also foreclose that argument.\nSimmons said that the potential for future “legislative\nreform” could not justify refusing a parole-ineligibility\ninstruction. 512 U.S., at 166 (plurality opinion). If it\nwere otherwise, a State could always argue that its legis-\nlature might pass a law rendering the defendant parole\neligible. Accordingly, as this Court later explained, “the\ndispositive fact in Simmons was that the defendant con-\nclusively established his parole ineligibility under state\nlaw at the time of his trial.” Ramdass, supra, at 171\n(plurality opinion). In this case, the Arizona Supreme\nCourt confirmed that parole was unavailable to Lynch\nunder its law. Simmons and its progeny establish Lynch’s\nright to inform his jury of that fact.\n   The petition for writ of certiorari and the motion for\nleave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.

Decided May 31, 2016\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins,\ndissenting.\n   Petitioner Shawn Patrick Lynch and his co-conspirator,\nMichael Sehwani, met their victim, James Panzarella, at a\nScottsdale bar on March 24, 2001. The three went back to\nPanzarella’s house early the next morning. Around 5 a.m.,\nSehwani called an escort service. The escort and her\nbodyguard arrived soon after. Sehwani paid her $300 with\ntwo checks from Panzarella’s checkbook after spending an\nhour with her in the bedroom. Lynch and Sehwani then\nleft the house with Panzarella’s credit and debit cards and\nembarked on a spending spree.\n   The afternoon of March 25, someone found Panzarella’s\nbody bound to a metal chair in his kitchen. His throat was\nslit. Blood surrounded him on the tile floor. The house\nwas in disarray. Police discovered a hunting knife in the\nbedroom. A knife was also missing from the kitchen’s\nknifeblock. And there were some receipts from Lynch and\nSehwani’s spending spree.\n   Police found Lynch and Sehwani at a motel two days\nafter the killing. They had spent the days with Panzarel-\nla’s credit and debit cards buying cigarettes, matches, gas,\nclothing, and Everlast shoes, renting movies at one of the\nmotels where they spent an afternoon, and making cash\nwithdrawals. When police found the pair, Sehwani wore\nthe Everlast shoes, and Lynch’s shoes were stained with\nPanzarella’s blood. A sweater, also stained with his blood,\nwas in the back seat of their truck, as were Panzarella’s\ncar keys.\n2                        LYNCH v. ARIZONA\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    A jury convicted Lynch of first-degree murder, kidnap-\ning, armed robbery, and burglary, and ultimately sen-\ntenced him to death.* But today, the Court decides that\nsentence is no good because the state trial court prohibited\nthe parties from telling the jury that Arizona had abol-\nished parole. Ante, at 1; see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §41–\n1604.09(I) (1999). The Court holds that this limitation on\nLynch’s sentencing proceeding violated Simmons v. South\nCarolina, 512 U.S. 154 (1994). Under Simmons, “[w]here\nthe State puts the defendant’s future dangerousness in\nissue, and the only available alternative sentence to death\nis life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due\nprocess entitles the defendant to inform the capital sen-\ntencing jury—by either argument or instruction—that he\nis parole ineligible.” Id., at 178 (O’Connor, J., concurring\nin judgment).\n    Today’s summary reversal perpetuates the Court’s error\nin Simmons. See Kelly v. South Carolina, 534 U.S. 246,\n262 (2002) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Shafer v. South Caro-\nlina, 532 U.S. 36, 58 (2001) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). As\nin Simmons, it is the “sheer depravity of [the defendant’s]\ncrimes, rather than any specific fear for the future, which\ninduced the . . . jury to conclude that the death penalty\nwas justice.” 512 U.S., at 181 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In\nSimmons, for example, the defendant beat and raped\nthree elderly women—one of them his own grandmother—\nbefore brutally killing a fourth. See ibid. The notion that\na jury’s decision to impose a death sentence “would have\nbeen altered by information on the current state of the law\nconcerning parole (which could of course be amended) is\n. . . farfetched,” to say the least. Id., at 184.\n\n——————\n  * Sehwani ultimately pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and theft\nand received a sentence of natural life without the possibility of early\nrelease plus one year. See 225 Ariz. 27, 33, n. 4, 234 P.3d 595, 601,\nn. 4 (2010).\n                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Worse, today’s decision imposes a magic-words require-\nment. Unlike Simmons, in which there was “no instruc-\ntion at all” about the meaning of life imprisonment except\nthat the term should be construed according to its “ ‘[plain]\nand ordinary meaning,’ ” id., at 160, 166 (plurality opin-\nion), here there was an instruction about the nature of the\nalternative life sentences that the trial court could impose:\n    “If your verdict is that the Defendant should be sen-\n    tenced to death, he will be sentenced to death. If your\n    verdict is that the Defendant should be sentenced to\n    life, he will not be sentenced to death, and the court\n    will sentence him to either life without the possibility\n    of release until at least 25 calendar years in prison\n    are served, or ‘natural life,’ which means the Defend-\n    ant would never be released from prison.” App. S to\n    Pet. for Cert. 18.\nThat instruction parallels the Arizona statute governing\nLynch’s sentencing proceedings. That statute prescribed\nthat defendants not sentenced to death could receive\neither a life sentence with the possibility of early release\nor a “natural life” sentence: “If the court does not sentence\nthe defendant to natural life, the defendant shall not be\nreleased on any basis until the completion of the service of\ntwenty-five calendar years,” but a defendant sentenced to\n“natural life” will “not be released on any basis for the\nremainder of the defendant’s natural life.” Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §13–703(A) (2001).\n  Even though the trial court’s instruction was a correct\nrecitation of Arizona law, the Court holds that Simmons\nrequires more. The Court laments that (at least for now)\nArizona’s only form of early release in Arizona is executive\nclemency. Ante, at 3. So the Court demands that the\nArizona instruction specify that “the possibility of release”\ndoes not (at least for now) include parole. Due process, the\nCourt holds, requires the court to tell the jury that if a\n4                    LYNCH v. ARIZONA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndefendant sentenced to life with the possibility of early\nrelease in 25 years were to seek early release today, he\nwould be ineligible for parole under Arizona law. Ante, at\n3–4. Nonsense. The Due Process Clause does not compel\nsuch “micromanage[ment of] state sentencing proceed-\nings.” Shafer, supra, at 58 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n  Today’s decision—issued without full briefing and ar-\ngument and based on Simmons, a fractured decision of\nthis Court that did not produce a majority opinion—is a\nremarkably aggressive use of our power to review the\nStates’ highest courts. The trial court accurately told the\njury that Lynch could receive a life sentence with or with-\nout the possibility of early release, and that should suffice.\n  I respectfully dissent.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.FLORIDA, PETITIONERv.ROBERT A. THOMAS\nNo. 00-391.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nArgued April 25, 2001Decided June 4, 2001\n\nSyllabus\nWhile officers were investigating marijuana sales and making arrests at a Florida home, respondent Thomas drove up, parked in the home's driveway, and walked toward the back of his car. An officer met him there and asked his name and whether he had a driver's license. After a check of Thomas' license revealed an outstanding warrant, the officer arrested him, handcuffed him, and took him inside the home. The officer then went back outside, alone, and searched Thomas' car, finding several bags containing methamphetamine. Thomas was charged with possession of that drug and related offenses. The trial court granted his motion to suppress the evidence of narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia. The Second District Court of Appeal reversed, finding the search valid under New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, in which this Court established a \"bright-line\" rule permitting an officer who has made a lawful custodial arrest of a car's occupant to search the car's passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest. Holding that Belton did not apply, the Florida Supreme Court reversed, but remanded for the trial court to determine whether the vehicle search was justified under Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752. This Court granted certiorari to consider whether, as the State Supreme Court had held, Belton's bright-line rule is limited to situations where the officer initiates contact with a vehicle's occupant while that person remains in the vehicle.\nHeld: The Court lacks jurisdiction to decide the question on which certiorari was granted. Although the parties did not raise the issue in their briefs on the merits, this Court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to decide this case. See Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch, 488 U.S. 299, 306. Title 28 U.S.C.  1257(a) authorizes this Court to review \"[f]inal judgments ... by the highest court of a State ... where any ... right ... is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution.\" In a criminal prosecution, finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence. Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 54. However, in certain circumstances, the Court has treated state-court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes even though further proceedings were to take place in the state court. Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U.S. 619, 620-621. In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 479-483, the Court divided cases of this kind into four categories: (1) cases in which there are further proceedings, even entire trials, yet to occur in the state courts, but where the federal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings preordained; (2) cases in which the federal issue, finally decided by a State's highest court, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings; (3) cases in which the federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case; and (4) cases in which the state courts have finally decided the federal issue with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review in this Court might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come. Because none of those categories fits the Florida Supreme Court's judgment in this case, the judgment is not final. Pp. 2-6.\nCertiorari dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Reported below: 761 So. 2d 1010.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA\nRehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nOpinion of the Court\nChief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981), we established a \"bright-line\" rule permitting a law enforcement officer who has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of a car to search the passenger compartment of that car as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest. We granted certiorari to consider whether that rule is limited to situations in which the officer initiates contact with the occupant of a vehicle while that person remains inside the vehicle. 531 U.S. 1069 (2000). We find, however, that we lack jurisdiction to decide the question.\n\n\n2\nOn the evening at issue, officers were present at a home in Polk County, Florida, investigating the sale of marijuana and making arrests. Respondent Robert Thomas drove up to the residence, parked in the driveway, and walked toward the back of his vehicle. Officer J. D. Maney met Thomas at the rear of Thomas' vehicle, and asked him his name and whether he had a driver's license. After a check of Thomas' license revealed an outstanding warrant for his arrest, Officer Maney arrested him, handcuffed him, and took him inside the residence. The officer then went back outside, alone, and searched Thomas' car. The search revealed several small bags containing a white substance that tested positive for methamphetamine.\n\n\n3\nRespondent was charged with possession of methamphetamine and related narcotics offenses. The trial court granted his motion to suppress the evidence of narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia. The Second District Court of Appeal reversed, 711 So. 2d 1241 (1998), finding the search valid under New York v. Belton, supra. The Supreme Court of Florida in turn reversed, holding that Belton did not apply.\n\n\n4\nThe court held that \"Belton's bright-line rule is limited to situations where the law enforcement officer initiates contact with the defendant\" while the defendant remains in the car. 761 So. 2d 1010, 1014 (2000). The court concluded that Belton was inapplicable, and directed that the trial court determine \"whether the factors in Chimel [v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969),] justify the search of Thomas' vehicle.\" 761 So. 2d, at 1014. The court explained that \"[b]ased on the record ... we are unable to ascertain whether [the officer's] safety was endangered or whether the preservation of the evidence was in jeopardy,\" as necessary to justify the search under Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969), and remanded for further proceedings.\n\n\n5\nAlthough the parties did not raise the issue in their briefs on the merits, we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to decide this case. See Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch, 488 U.S. 299, 306 (1989). Title 28 U.S.C.  1257(a) authorizes this Court to review \"[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had ... where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution.\" In a criminal prosecution, finality generally \"is defined by a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence.\" Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 54 (1989). But we have not, in practice, interpreted the finality rule so strictly. In certain circumstances, we have \"treated state-court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although there were further proceedings to take place in the state court.\" Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U.S. 619, 620-621 (1981) (per curiam). In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469 (1975), we divided cases of this kind into four categories. None fits the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court, however, and we therefore conclude that its judgment is not final.\n\n\n6\nThe first Cox category includes those cases in which \"there are further proceedings-even entire trials-yet to occur in the state courts but where for one reason or another the federal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings preordained.\" Id., at 479. The prototypical example of this category is Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214 (1966). There the Supreme Court of Alabama held that a statute which prohibited the publication of an editorial endorsement on election day did not violate the First Amendment, and remanded the case for trial. Id., at 216-217. Mills conceded that his only defense to the state charge was his constitutional claim; he admitted that he did publish the editorial. We held that this was a \"final judgment\" and took jurisdiction, saying that a trial \"would be no more than a few formal gestures leading inexorably towards a conviction, and then another appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court for it formally to repeat its rejection of Mills' constitutional contentions whereupon the case could then once more wind its weary way back to us as a judgment unquestionably final and appealable. Such a roundabout process would not only be an inexcusable delay of the benefits Congress intended to grant by providing for appeal to this Court, but it would also result in a completely unnecessary waste of time and energy in judicial systems already troubled by delays due to congested dockets.\" Id., at 217-218.\n\n\n7\nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Florida here differs considerably from that of the state court in Mills. The Florida Supreme Court remanded the case not only for application of Chimel, but for further factfinding, and the State has not conceded that the search is invalid under Chimel.\n\n\n8\nIn Cox's second category are those cases in which \"the federal issue, finally decided by the highest court in the State, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings.\" 420 U.S., at 480. In Cox we used our decision in Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johnson, 326 U.S. 120 (1945), to illustrate the second category. We said: \"In Radio Station WOW, the Nebraska Supreme Court directed the transfer of the properties of a federally licensed radio station and ordered an accounting, rejecting the claim that the transfer order would interfere with the federal license... . Nothing that could happen in the course of the accounting, short of settlement of the case, would foreclose or make unnecessary decision on the federal question.\" Cox, supra, at 480.\n\n\n9\nIn this case, however, were the Florida courts to find that Chimel allows the search, a decision on the Belton issue would no longer be necessary. We have also noted that we treat state-court judgments in this category as final on the assumption that \" 'the federal questions that could come here have been adjudicated by the State court,' \" and the state proceedings to take place on remand \" 'could not remotely give rise to a federal question ... that may later come here.' \" Cox, 420 U.S., at 480. We cannot make that assumption in this case.\n\n\n10\nCases where \"the federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case,\" fall into Cox's third category. Id., at 481. New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649 (1984), is such a case. Respondent was charged in state court with criminal possession of a weapon, and certain evidence was suppressed on federal constitutional grounds. We granted the petition for certiorari and reversed, explaining that the suppression ruling was a \"final judgment\" although respondent had yet to be tried. Id., at 651. We said that this case fell within Cox's third category because \"should the State convict respondent at trial, its claim that certain evidence was wrongfully suppressed will be moot. Should respondent be acquitted at trial, the State will be precluded from pressing its federal claim again on appeal.\" 467 U.S., at 651, and n. 1.\n\n\n11\nTo deny review here would not necessarily cause Florida to go to trial without the suppressed evidence, with further appeal barred in the event of an acquittal or the federal claim mooted in the event of a conviction. The state court has yet to decide whether the evidence should be suppressed; that will be resolved on remand. If the State prevails on remand and the evidence is admitted under Chimel, then the Belton issue will be moot, and the State cannot seek review of it. But if the State loses, and the evidence is suppressed, Florida law allows the State to appeal, as long as it does so prior to trial. Fla. Stat. 924.071(1) (1996) (\"The state may appeal from a pretrial order ... suppressing evidence\"); Fla. Rule App. Proc. 9.140(c)(1)(B) (2001) (\"The state may appeal an order ... suppressing before trial ... evidence obtained by search and seizure\"). Should the Supreme Court of Florida rule against the State on the Chimel issue, the question of suppression would be finally decided by the Florida courts, and the State could then seek certiorari in this Court. At that time it could obtain review of both the Belton issue and the Chimel issue. See Jefferson v. City of Tarrant, 522 U.S. 75, 83 (1997).\n\n\n12\nThe fourth Cox category includes those cases where \"the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come. In these circumstances, if a refusal immediately to review the state-court decision might seriously erode federal policy, the Court has entertained and decided the federal issue, which itself has been finally determined by the state courts for purposes of the state litigation.\" 420 U.S., at 482-483.\n\n\n13\nHere the State can make no claim of serious erosion of federal policy that is not common to all run-of-the-mine decisions suppressing evidence in criminal trials. The fourth Cox exception does not apply here.\n\n\n14\nFor the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n15\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) ruled that respondent did not qualify for such protection based on the persecution he faced when he left Guatemala in 1993. The Ninth Circuit reversed and then went on to address the Government's alternative argument that respondent did not qualify for protection regardless of past persecution because conditions in Guatemala had improved to the point where no realistic persecution threat existed. Because the BIA had not considered this argument, both sides asked the court to remand the case to the BIA. The court, however, evaluated the Government's claim itself, holding that the evidence failed to show a sufficient change.\nHeld: Well-established administrative-law principles required the Ninth Circuit to remand the \"changed circumstances\" question to the BIA. Where, as here, the law entrusts the agency to make the basic decision in question, a judicial judgment cannot be substituted for an administrative one, SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88, and an appellate court's proper course is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation, Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744. The BIA has not yet considered the \"changed circumstances\" issue, and every consideration classically supporting the law's ordinary remand requirement does so here: The agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the matter; can evaluate the evidence; can make an initial determination; and, in doing so, can, through informed discussion and analysis, help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides. Here, the Ninth Circuit seriously disregarded the agency's legally mandated role. It independently created a potentially far-reaching legal precedent about the significance of political change in Guatemala, a highly complex and sensitive matter, without giving the BIA the opportunity to address the matter in the first instance in light of its expertise. The court's reliance on a 1997 State Department report about Guatemala is legally inadequate because the report was ambiguous about changed circumstances, and because remand could lead to the presentation of further evidence of current circumstances, which may well prove enlightening given that five years have elapsed since the report was written.\nCertiorari granted; 264 F.3d 1150, reversed and remanded.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nFederal statutes authorize the Attorney General, in his discretion, to grant asylum to an alien who demonstrates \"persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of . . . [a] political opinion,\" and they require the Attorney General to withhold deportation where the alien's \"life or freedom would be threatened\" for that reason. Immigration and Nationality Act, §§ 101(a)(42)(A), 208(a), 243(h), 66 Stat. 166, as amended, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42), 1158(a), 1253(h)(1) (1994 ed. and Supp. V). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined that respondent Fredy Orlando Ventura failed to qualify for this statutory protection because any persecution that he faced when he left Guatemala in 1993 was not \"on account of\" a \"political opinion.\" The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the BIA's holding. 264 F.3d 1150 (2001) (emphasis added).\n\n\n2\nThe Court of Appeals then went on to consider an alternative argument that the Government had made before the Immigration Judge, namely, that Orlando Ventura failed to qualify for protection regardless of past persecution because conditions in Guatemala had improved to the point where no realistic threat of persecution currently existed. Both sides pointed out to the Ninth Circuit that the Immigration Judge had held that conditions had indeed changed to that point but that the BIA itself had not considered this alternative claim. And both sides asked that the Ninth Circuit remand the case to the BIA so that it might do so. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-71004 (CA9), pp. 5, 6, 24; Brief for Respondent in No. 99-71004 (CA9), pp. 8, 9, 23.\n\n\n3\nThe Court of Appeals, however, did not remand the case. Instead, it evaluated the Government's claim itself. And it decided the matter in Orlando Ventura's favor, holding that the evidence in the record failed to show sufficient change. 264 F.3d, at 1157-1158. The Government, seeking certiorari here, argues that the Court of Appeals exceeded its legal authority when it decided the \"changed circumstances\" matter on its own. We agree with the Government that the Court of Appeals should have remanded the case to the BIA. And we summarily reverse its decision not to do so.\n\n\n4\n* We shall describe the basic proceedings so far. In 1993 Orlando Ventura, a citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States illegally. In 1995 the Attorney General began deportation proceedings. And in 1998 an Immigration Judge considered Orlando Ventura's application for asylum and withholding of deportation, an application based upon a fear and threat of persecution \"on account of\" a \"political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42)(A), 1253(h) (1994 ed. and Supp. V). Orlando Ventura testified that he had received threats of death or harm unless he joined the guerrilla army, that his family members had close ties to the Guatemalan military, and that, in his view, the guerrillas consequently believed he held inimical political opinions.\n\n\n5\nThe Immigration Judge denied relief. She recognized that Orlando Ventura subjectively believed that the guerrillas' interest in him was politically based. And she credited testimony showing (a) that Orlando Ventura's family had many connections to the military, (b) that he was very close to one cousin, an army lieutenant who had served for almost 12 years, (c) that in 1987 his uncle, a local military commissioner responsible for recruiting, was attacked by people with machetes, and (d) that in 1988 his cousin (a soldier) and the cousin's brother (a civilian) were both shot at and the soldier-cousin killed. Nonetheless, Orlando Ventura had failed objectively \"to demonstrate that the guerillas' interest\" in him was \"on account of his political opinion.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a. The Immigration Judge added that \"conditions\" in Guatemala had changed significantly. Even \"if the guerillas\" once had had a politically based \"interest\" in Orlando Ventura, the evidence failed to show that the guerrillas would \"continue to have motivation and inclination to persecute him in the future.\" Ibid.\n\n\n6\nThe BIA, considering the matter de novo, \"agree[d]\" with the Immigration Judge that Orlando Ventura \"did not meet his burden of establishing that he faces persecution `on account of' a qualifying ground . . . .\" Id., at 15a. The BIA added that it \"need not address\" the question of \"changed country conditions.\" Ibid.\n\n\n7\nThe Court of Appeals, reviewing the BIA's decision, decided that this evidence \"compel[led]\" it to reject the BIA's conclusion. 264 F.3d, at 1154 (emphasis added); see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481, n. 1 (1992) (\"To reverse the BIA finding we must find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion, but compels it . . .\" (emphasis in original)). It recognized that the BIA had not decided the \"changed circumstances\" question and that \"generally\" a court should remand to permit that consideration. 264 F.3d, at 1157. Cf. Castillo v. INS, 951 F.2d 1117, 1120-1121 (CA9 1991) (specifying that the Court of Appeals must review the decision of the BIA, not the underlying decision of the immigration judge). But the Court of Appeals added that it need \"not remand ... when it is clear that we would be compelled to reverse the BIA's decision if the BIA decided the matter against the applicant.\" 264 F.3d, at 1157. And it held that the record evidence, namely, a 1997 State Department report about Guatemala, \"clearly demonstrates that the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution was not rebutted.\" Ibid. Hence, it concluded, \"remand ... is inappropriate.\" Ibid. The Government challenges the decision not to remand. And it says the matter is important. The \"error,\" it says, is a \"recurring error [that] puts the Ninth Circuit in conflict with other courts of appeals, which generally respect the BIA's role as fact-finder by remanding to the BIA in similar situations.\" Pet. for Cert. 11. See also Pet. for Cert. in INS v. Chen, O. T. 2002, No. 25, p. 23 (referring to eight other recent decisions from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which, in the Government's view, demonstrate this trend). After examining the record, we find that well-established principles of administrative law did require the Court of Appeals to remand the \"changed circumstances\" question to the BIA.\n\nII\n\n8\nNo one disputes the basic legal principles that govern remand. Within broad limits the law entrusts the agency to make the basic asylum eligibility decision here in question. E.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a); 8 U.S.C. § 1253(h)(1) (1994 ed.); Elias-Zacarias, supra, at 481; INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415 (1999). See also 8 CFR § 3.1 (2002). In such circumstances a \"judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.\" SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943). Nor can an \"appellate court ... intrude upon the domain which Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency.\" Ibid. A court of appeals \"is not generally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.\" Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985). Rather, \"the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\" Ibid. Cf. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947) (describing the reasons for remand).\n\n\n9\nGenerally speaking, a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands. This principle has obvious importance in the immigration context. The BIA has not yet considered the \"changed circumstances\" issue. And every consideration that classically supports the law's ordinary remand requirement does so here. The agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the matter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial determination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed discussion and analysis, help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.\n\n\n10\nThese basic considerations indicate that the Court of Appeals committed clear error here. It seriously disregarded the agency's legally mandated role. Instead, it independently created potentially far-reaching legal precedent about the significance of political change in Guatemala, a highly complex and sensitive matter. And it did so without giving the BIA the opportunity to address the matter in the first instance in light of its own expertise.\n\n\n11\nThe Court of Appeals rested its conclusion upon its belief that the basic record evidence on the matter — the 1997 State Department report about Guatemala — compelled a finding of insufficiently changed circumstances. But that foundation is legally inadequate for two reasons. First, the State Department report is, at most, ambiguous about the matter. The bulk of the report makes clear that considerable change has occurred. The report says, for example, that in December 1996 the Guatemalan Government and the guerrillas signed a peace agreement, that in March 1996 there was a cease fire, that the guerrillas then disbanded as a fighting force, that \"the guerrillas renounced the use of force to achieve political goals,\" and that \"there was [a] marked improvement in the overall human rights situation.\" Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Dept. of State, Guatemala-Profile of Asylum Claims & Country Conditions 2-4 (June 1997).\n\n\n12\nAs the Court of Appeals stressed, two parts of the report can be read to the contrary. They say that (1) even \"after the March cease-fire, guerrillas continued to employ death threats\" and (2) \"the level of crime and violence now seems to be higher than in the recent past.\" Id., at 3-4. Yet the report itself qualifies these statements. As to the second, the report (as the Court of Appeals noted) says: \"Although the level of crime and violence now seems to be higher than in the recent past, the underlying motivation in most asylum cases now appears to stem from common crime and/or personal vengeance,\" i.e., not politics. Id., at 4 (emphasis added). And the report (in sections to which the Court of Appeals did not refer) adds that in the context of claims based on political opinion, in \"our experience, only party leaders or high-profile activists generally would be vulnerable to such harassment and usually only in their home communities.\" Id., at 8. This latter phrase \"only in their home communities\" is particularly important in light of the fact that an individual who can relocate safely within his home country ordinarily cannot qualify for asylum here. See 8 CFR § 208.13(b)(1)(i) (2002).\n\n\n13\nSecond, remand could lead to the presentation of further evidence of current circumstances in Guatemala — evidence that may well prove enlightening given the five years that have elapsed since the report was written. See §§ 3.1, 3.2 (permitting the BIA to reopen the record and to remand to the Immigration Judge as appropriate).\n\nIII\n\n14\nWe conclude that the Court of Appeals should have applied the ordinary \"remand\" rule. We grant the Government's petition for certiorari. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit insofar as it denies remand to the agency. And we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n15\n\nSo ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

LORENZO JOHNSON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 11–1053. Decided May 29, 2012\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Respondent Lorenzo Johnson was convicted as an ac-\ncomplice and co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Wil-\nliams, who was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest in\nthe early morning hours of December 15, 1995, in Har-\nrisburg, Pennsylvania. After his conviction was affirmed\nin state court, Johnson exhausted his state remedies and\nsought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court\npursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penal-\nty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S. C. §2254. The District\nCourt denied habeas relief but the U. S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the evidence\nat trial was insufficient to support Johnson’s conviction\nunder the standard set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 443\nU.S. 307 (1979).\n   We have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar\nin federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to\ntwo layers of judicial deference. First, on direct appeal, “it\nis the responsibility of the jury—not the court—to decide\nwhat conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted\nat trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury’s verdict\non the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational\ntrier of fact could have agreed with the jury.” Cavazos v.\nSmith, 565 U.S. 1, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 1).\nAnd second, on habeas review, “a federal court may not\noverturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of\nthe evidence challenge simply because the federal court\n2                  COLEMAN v. JOHNSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndisagrees with the state court. The federal court instead\nmay do so only if the state court decision was ‘objectively\nunreasonable.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5)).\n  Because the Court of Appeals failed to afford due respect\nto the role of the jury and the state courts of Pennsylvania,\nwe now grant certiorari and reverse the judgment below.\n                         *    *     *\n   The parties agree that Williams was shot and killed\nby Corey Walker, who was subsequently convicted of first-\ndegree murder. Johnson was with Walker on the night of\nthe crime, and the two were tried jointly. Johnson was\ncharged as an accomplice and co-conspirator. See 18 Pa.\nCons. Stat. §2502 (2008) (defining first-degree murder\nas “willful, deliberate and premeditated” killing); §306(c)\n(imposing accomplice liability for anyone who, “with the\nintent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the\noffense . . . aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other\nperson in planning or committing it”); Commonwealth v.\nMontalvo, 598 Pa. 263, 274, 956 A.2d 926, 932 (2008)\n(criminal conspiracy liability for anyone who takes an\novert act in furtherance of a crime he has agreed to abet or\ncommit).\n   At trial, the Commonwealth called Victoria Doubs, who\ntestified that she, Johnson, and Walker were “close\nfriends” who “ran the streets together.” Tr. 213. On the\nmorning of December 14, the three of them awoke at the\nsame residence, bought marijuana, and then went to a\nKentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, where they encoun-\ntered Williams. Walker announced that he was going to\n“holler at” Williams about a debt Williams owed. Id., at\n217. According to Doubs, Walker and Williams “were\ntalking about the money that [Williams] had owed us,”\nwith Walker “asking [Williams], confronting him, about\nhis money and what’s up with the money and why is it\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ntaking you so long to give us the money.” Id., at 217–218.\nWilliams was “cussing [Walker] out, telling him he’d\ngive it to him when he felt like it and he ain’t scared of\n[Walker].” Id., at 218. A fight ensued, which ended\nwhen Williams beat Walker with a broomstick in front\nof the crowd of people that had gathered.\n   After the fight, Doubs testified, Walker “was mad, be-\ncause he got beat by a crackhead. . . . He was saying, yo,\nthat crackhead beat me. I’m going to kill that crackhead.\nI’m going to kill that kid. . . . He was hot. He was heated.”\nId., at 220–221. Johnson was present when Walker made\nthese statements. Later that afternoon, Doubs recounted\nthe beating to others, who laughed at Walker. Walker\n“repeated it for a while that I’m going to kill that kid.\nThat kid must think I’m some type of joke. I’m going to\nkill that kid. Who he think he is[?]” Id., at 222. Once\nagain, Johnson was present for these statements.\n   Another witness was Carla Brown, a friend of the victim,\nwho testified that she was at the Midnight Special Bar\non the night of December 14–15, where she saw Walker,\nJohnson, and Williams engaged in a heated argument.\nAlthough she could not hear what they were saying, she\ncould tell they were arguing because they were making “a\nlot of arm movements.” Id., at 104. The bouncer soon told\nthem to leave, and Brown followed them into the street\nbecause she “wanted to know what was going on.” Ibid.\nBrown observed the three men walking in a single-file\nline, with Walker in front, Williams in the middle, and\nJohnson in the back. Walker was wearing a long leather\ncoat, walking as if he had something concealed under-\nneath it. Brown followed the three men to an alleyway, at\nwhich point Williams recognized Brown and told her to “go\nahead” and pass. Id., at 107. Walker then entered the\nalleyway, followed by Williams, while Johnson remained\nstanding at the entrance. As Brown walked past the alley,\nshe heard a loud “boom,” causing her to run away. Id., at\n4                  COLEMAN v. JOHNSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n143. On cross-examination, Brown stated: “They walked\n[Williams] in that alley. He stood inside the alley. He\nwalked him in the alley. I heard a boom.” Ibid.\n   The Commonwealth also called Aaron Dews, who testi-\nfied that he was in a building bordering the alleyway at\n12:45 a.m. on the morning of December 15. He heard a\nloud boom that caused him to look out into the alley from\nhis second-story window, where he saw two silhouettes\nfleeing.\n   After Dews the Commonwealth called Brian Ramsey,\nwho had been selling cocaine on a nearby street corner at\nthe time of the murder. He testified that he saw Williams\nwalking toward an alleyway with two males and a female,\nand he heard a loud boom shortly after Williams entered\nthe alley. When pressed on cross-examination, he stated:\n“I would say that [Williams] was forced in that alley.” Id.,\nat 189.\n   The jury also heard testimony from police who searched\nthe alley shortly after the murder and found a shotgun\nwith the barrel missing. A medical examiner who exam-\nined Williams’ body testified that the cause of death was a\nshotgun wound to the chest.\n   After the jury convicted Johnson, he filed a post-trial\nmotion arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sup-\nport his conviction. The court denied his motion, and\nthe Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the conviction\non direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 726\nA.2d 1079 (1998). After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\ndenied his petition for review, Johnson unsuccessfully\nsought state postconviction relief. He then filed a habeas\npetition in Federal District Court, which denied his\nclaims. See Johnson v. Mechling, 541 F. Supp. 2d 651\n(MD Pa. 2008). Finally, Johnson appealed to the Third\nCircuit, which reversed the District Court and ordered his\nconviction overturned.\n   Under Jackson, evidence is sufficient to support a con-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nviction if, “after viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime be-\nyond a reasonable doubt.” 443 U. S., at 319.\n   In light of the testimony at Johnson’s trial, the Court of\nAppeals acknowledged that “[a] trier of fact could reason-\nably infer . . . that Johnson and Walker shared a common\nintent to confront, threaten or harass Williams.” Johnson\nv. Mechling, 446 Fed. Appx. 531, 540 (CA3 2011). As for\nthe notion that “Johnson shared Walker’s intent to kill\nWilliams,” however, the court concluded that was “mere\nspeculation” that no rational factfinder could accept as\ntrue. Ibid. The court stated that “a reasonable inference\nis one where the fact inferred is ‘more likely than not to\nflow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.’ ”\nId., at 539–540 (quoting Commonwealth v. McFarland,\n452 Pa. 435, 439, 308 A.2d 592, 594 (1973)). In order for a\njury’s inferences to be permissible, the court reasoned,\nthey must “ ‘flow from facts and circumstances proven in\nthe record’ ” that are “ ‘of such volume and quality as to\novercome the presumption of innocence.’ ” 446 Fed. Appx.,\nat 539 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bostick, 958 A.2d 543,\n560 (Pa. Super. 2008)).\n   At the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of\nAppeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what\ndistinguishes a reasoned inference from “mere specula-\ntion.” Under Jackson, federal courts must look to state\nlaw for “the substantive elements of the criminal offense,”\n443 U. S., at 324, n. 16, but the minimum amount of evi-\ndence that the Due Process Clause requires to prove the\noffense is purely a matter of federal law.\n   Under the deferential federal standard, the approach\ntaken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it un-\nduly impinged on the jury’s role as factfinder. Jackson\nleaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences\nto draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring\n6                  COLEMAN v. JOHNSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nonly that jurors “draw reasonable inferences from basic\nfacts to ultimate facts.” Id., at 319. This deferential\nstandard does not permit the type of fine-grained factual\nparsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged. For ex-\nample, in addressing Brown and Ramsey’s testimony that\nWilliams was “walked” and “forced” into the alleyway, the\ncourt objected that the witnesses did not describe any\n“physical action” supporting the conclusion that force was\nused. 446 Fed. Appx., at 541. Absent some specific testi-\nmony that “Johnson actively pushed, shoved, ordered or\notherwise forced the victim into the alley, or prevented\nhim from leaving it,” ibid., the court could see no reason-\nable basis for the jury’s conclusion that Johnson had a\nspecific intent to help kill Williams.\n   That analysis is flawed for two reasons. First, the coer-\ncive nature of Johnson and Walker’s behavior could be\ninferred from other circumstances not involving the direct\nuse of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon,\nand he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams\nafter a violent confrontation earlier in the day. Johnson\nand Walker kept Williams between them in a single-file\nline on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the\nentrance while the other two entered, suggesting that\nJohnson may have been prepared to prevent Williams\nfrom fleeing. And second, even if Williams was not co-\nerced into the alley, the jury still could have concluded\nthat Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the\nmurder.\n   Taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the\ntrial testimony revealed that Johnson and Walker “ran\nthe streets together,” and had attempted to collect a debt\nfrom Williams earlier on the day of the murder. Williams\nresisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in\nthe process by giving him a public thrashing with a\nbroomstick. This enraged Walker to the point that he\nrepeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnson’s\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\npresence that he intended to kill Williams. Then, while\nWalker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his\ntrenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley,\nwhere Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled\nout a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest.\n   On the basis of these facts, a rational jury could infer\nthat Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shot-\ngun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped\nusher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate. The\njury in this case was convinced, and the only question\nunder Jackson is whether that finding was so insupporta-\nble as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality. The\nstate court of last review did not think so, and that deter-\nmination in turn is entitled to considerable deference\nunder AEDPA, 28 U.S. C. §2254(d).\n   Affording due respect to the role of the jury and the\nstate courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnson’s\ntrial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due pro-\ncess challenge under Jackson. The evidence was sufficient\nto convict Johnson as an accomplice and a co-conspirator\nin the murder of Taraja Williams. The Commonwealth’s\npetition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in forma\npauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Ap-\npeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

This case is an obvious attempt to avoid the application of McCleskey v. Zant, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991), to bar this successive claim for relief.  Harris has now filed four prior federal habeas petitions.  He has made no convincing showing of cause for his failure to raise this claim in his prior petitions.\n\n\n2\nEven if we were to assume, however, that Harris could avoid the application of McCleskey to bar his claim, we would not consider it on the merits.  Whether his claim is framed as a habeas petition or § 1983 action, Harris seeks an equitable remedy.  Equity must take into consideration the State's strong interest in proceeding with its judgment and Harris' obvious attempt at manipulation.  See In re Blodgett, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 674, 116 L.Ed.2d 669 (1992);  Delo v. Stokes, 495 U.S. 320, 110 S.Ct. 1880, 109 L.Ed.2d 325 (1990) (KENNEDY, J., concurring).  This claim could have been brought more than a decade ago.  There is no good reason for this abusive delay, which has been compounded by last-minute attempts to manipulate the judicial process.  A court may consider the last-minute nature of an application to stay execution in deciding whether to grant equitable relief.\n\n\n3\nThe application to vacate the stay of execution of death is granted, and it is ordered that the orders staying the execution of Robert Alton Harris entered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in No. 92-70237 on April 20, 1992 are vacated.\n\n\n4\nJustice STEVENS, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.\n\n\n5\nIn a time when the Court's jurisprudence concerning the imposition of the death penalty grows ever more complicated, Robert Alton Harris brings a simple claim.  He argues that California's method of execution—exposure to cyanide gas constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and therefore violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  In light of all that we know today about the extreme and unnecessary pain inflicted by execution by cyanide gas, and in light of the availability of more humane and less violent methods of execution, Harris' claim has merit.  I would deny the State's application to vacate the stay imposed by the Court of Appeals and allow the courts below to hear and rule on Harris' claim.\n\n\n6\nExecution by cyanide gas is \"in essence asphyxiation by suffocation or strangulation.\"1  As dozens of uncontroverted expert statements filed in this case illustrate, execution by cyanide gas is extremely and unnecessarily painful.\n\n\n7\n\"Following inhalation of cyanide gas, a person will first      experience hypoxia, a condition defined as a lack of oxygen      in the body.  The hypoxic state can continue for several      minutes after the cyanide gas is released in the execution      chamber.  During this time, a person will remain conscious      and immediately may suffer extreme pain throughout his arms,      shoulders, back, and chest.  The sensation may be similar to      pain felt by a person during a massive heart attack.\"2\n\n\n8\n\"Execution by gas. . . . produces prolonged seizures, incontinence of stool and urine, salivation, vomiting, retching, ballistic writhing, flailing, twitching of extremities, [and] grimacing.\"3  This suffering lasts for 8 to 10 minutes, or longer.4\n\n\n9\nEyewitness descriptions of executions by cyanide gas lend depth to these clinical accounts.  On April 6, 1992, Arizona executed Don Eugene Harding.\n\n\n10\n\"When the fumes enveloped Don's head he took a quick breath.      A few seconds later he again looked in my direction.  His      face was red and contorted as if he were attempting to fight      through tremendous pain.  His mouth was pursed shut and his      jaw was clenched tight.  Don then took several more quick      gulps of the fumes.\n\n\n11\n\"At this point Don's body started convulsing violently. . . .      His face and body turned a deep red and the veins in his      temple and neck began to bulge until I thought they might      explode.\n\n\n12\n\"After about a minute Don's face leaned partially forward,      but he was still conscious.  Every few seconds he continued      to gulp in.  He was shuddering uncontrollably and his body      was racked with spasms.  His head continued to snap back.      His hands were clenched.\n\n\n13\n\"After several more minutes, the most violent of the      convulsions subsided.  At this time the muscles along Don's      left arm and back began twitching in a wavelike motion under      his skin.  Spittle drooled from his mouth.\n\n\n14\n\"Don did not stop moving for approximately eight minutes, and      after that he continued to twitch and jerk for another      minute.  Approximately two minutes later, we were told by a      prison official that the execution was complete.\n\n\n15\n\"Don Harding took ten minutes and thirty one seconds to die.\"5\n\n\n16\nThe unnecessary cruelty of this method of execution convinced Arizona's Attorney General that that State should abandon execution by gas in favor of execution by lethal injection.6  His conclusion coincides with that of numerous medical, legal, and ethical experts.7\n\n\n17\nThe prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment \"is not fastened to the obsolete, but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.\"  Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 378, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910). Accordingly, we have \"interpreted th[e Eighth] Amendment 'in a flexible and dynamic manner.' \"  Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361, 369, 109 S.Ct. 2969, 2974, 106 L.Ed.2d 306 (1989) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 171, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2924, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.)).  When the California statute requiring execution by cyanide gas was enacted in 1937, the gas chamber was considered a humane method of execution.  Fifty-five years of history and moral development have superseded that judgment.  The barbaric use of cyanide gas in the Holocaust, the development of cyanide agents as chemical weapons, our contemporary understanding of execution by lethal gas, and the development of less cruel methods of execution all demonstrate that execution by cyanide gas is unnecessarily cruel.  \"The traditional humanity of modern Anglo-American law forbids the infliction of unnecessary pain in the execution of the death sentence.\"  Louisiana v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 463, 67 S.Ct. 374, 376, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947) (opinion of Reed, J.).\n\n\n18\nNowhere is this moral progress better demonstrated than in the decisions of the State legislatures.  Of the 20 or so States to adopt new methods of execution since our ruling in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976), not a single State has chosen execution by lethal gas.  Ten years ago, 10 States mandated execution by lethal gas;  one by one, those States have abandoned that method as inhumane and torturous.  Only California, Maryland, and Arizona currently mandate execution by gas.8  Of the 168 persons executed in the United States since 1977, only 6 have been executed by lethal gas.  We have frequently emphasized that \"[t]he clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country's legislatures.\"  Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 331, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 2953, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989).  These \"objective indicia that reflect the public attitude\" toward execution by lethal gas, Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S., at 370, 109 S.Ct., at 2975, clearly exhibit a nearly universal rejection of that means of execution.9  Cf. Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 788-796, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 3371-3376, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982);  Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 593-597, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 2866-2869, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977).  All of this leads me to conclude that execution by cyanide gas is both cruel and unusual, and that it violates contemporary standards of human decency.10\n\n\n19\nMore than a century ago, we declared that \"[p]unishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death.\"  In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 447, 10 S.Ct. 930, 933-934, 34 L.Ed. 519 (1890).  In light of our contemporary understanding of the methods of execution and in light of less cruel alternatives presently available, I believe that execution by cyanide gas is \"incompatible with 'the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.' \"  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958) (plurality opinion)).\n\n\n20\nThe State contends that Harris should have brought his claim earlier.  This is not reason enough to upset the stay issued by the Court of Appeals and dispatch the considered judgment of the 14 appellate judges who voted to rehear the case en banc.  Indeed, although reluctant to recognize as much, the State itself could have avoided this last-minute litigation.  In 1983, seven States authorized executions by exposure to cyanide gas.  In that year, three Members of this Court indicated that that method of execution raised sufficiently serious questions under the Eighth Amendment to merit review by writ of certiorari.  See Gray v. Lucas, 463 U.S. 1237, 104 S.Ct. 211, 77 L.Ed.2d 1453 (1983).  Thereafter, four States (Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wyoming) abandoned cyanide gas as a method of execution.  In light of these events and the decisions of other legislatures, California as well should have revisited its 55-year-old statute.\n\n\n21\nMore fundamentally, if execution by cyanide gas is in fact unconstitutional, then the State lacks the power to impose such punishment.  Harris' delay, even if unjustified, cannot endow the State with the authority to violate the Constitution.  It was this principle that animated Justice Harlan's opinion in Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 692-693, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 1179-1180, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971), and that a plurality of this Court embraced in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 306-307, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1072-1073, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.).  As Harlan emphasized, there are some instances in which the State's interest in finality must give way.  When the challenged conduct falls clearly beyond the State's legitimate power, \"[t]here is little societal interest in permitting the criminal process to rest at a point where it ought properly never to repose.\"  401 U.S., at 693, 91 S.Ct. at 1180.  For these reasons, the State's interest in an immediate execution must yield to a deliberate and careful study of the merits of Harris' claims.\n\n\n22\nAccordingly, I dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n Exhibits in Support of Motion for Temporary Restraining Order in No. 92-70237 (ND Cal.)

See Exhibits, Vol. IV, Exh. 62 (H.B. 2055).\n\n\n7\n See, e.g., Exhibits, Vol. I, Exh. 1 at 3;  Vol. I, Exh. 2 at 3 (Declaration of Robert H. Kirschner, M.D.);  Col. I, Exh. 4 at 3 (Declaration of Kent R. Olson, M.D.).\n\n\n8\n As noted above, Arizona is considering abandoning lethal gas as a means of execution.  Supra n. 6.  Maryland has not yet resumed executions.\n\n\n9\n Notably, a memorandum prepared by California corrections officials correctly observes that \"[l]ethal injection is considered to be more humane than other methods of execution (e.g., hanging, firing squad, lethal gas, or electrocution).\" Exhibits, Vol. I, Exh. 11 at 4.\n\n\n10\n In Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 135-136, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1878), we ruled that punishments of \"unnecessary cruelty\" violated the Eighth Amendment, citing the ancient practices of drawing and quartering and \"public dissecting\" as examples. Similarly in In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 446, 10 S.Ct. 930, 933, 34 L.Ed. 519 (1890), we indicated that \"burning at the stake, crucifixion, [and] breaking on the wheel\" were as well cruel and unusual.  To that list we might have added the garrotte, a device for execution by strangulation developed—and abandoned—centuries ago in Spain.  See G. Scott, The History of Capital Punishment 159-160 (1950).  To my mind, the gas chamber is nothing more than a chemical garrotte.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

JOSE, TRUSTEE OF JOSE BUSINESS TRUST, ET AL.\nNo. 95-2082.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nDecember 2, 1996, Decided\n\nOn Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nCertiorari granted; 71 F.3d 1484, reversed and remanded.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPetitioners, the United States of America and Leslie M. Nishimura, Revenue Agent of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS or Service), commenced a proceeding to enforce two IRS summonses issued to Laddie F. Jose, as trustee for the Jose Business Trust and Jose Family Trust. The Service represented to the Magistrate that the documents sought \"are for the purpose of a civil investigation.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. The Magistrate found the summonses valid and enforceable for the purpose stated. He did not address the question whether the summons enforcement requirements \"would be satisfied in the event petitioners decide to pursue a criminal tax investigation.\" Ibid. That question was not before him in view of the sole purpose--civil investigation--specified by the IRS. Ibid.\n\n\n2\nThe Magistrate recommended that the District Court (1) enforce petitioners' summonses, and (2) require the IRS to give respondent five days' notice prior to any circulation or transfer of the summoned documents to any division of the IRS other than the Examination Division. Id. at 20a-21a.\n\n\n3\nBefore the District Court, neither party objected to the finding that the alleged civil investigation was a legitimate purpose and that the summonses are valid and should be enforced. Id. at 16a. The single issue in controversy was \"whether [the court] may restrict enforcement of petitioners' summonses by requiring the IRS to notify respondent five days in advance before circulating, transferring, or copying the summon[ed] documents to any other division of the IRS, including its Criminal Investigation Division.\" Id. at 15a. The District Court determined that the restriction was lawful and proper and entered a final order to that effect. Id. at 19a.\n\n\n4\nThe Service appealed, asserting that the District Court lacked authority to impose the restriction. The Ninth Circuit correctly recognized that it had jurisdiction \"pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291,\" which authorizes appeals from \"final decisions.\" It nonetheless dismissed the appeal \"as not ripe.\" 71 F.3d 1484, 1485 (1995). The majority stated:\n\n\n5\n\"The record indicates that the IRS represented to the district court that the documents  ]  requested of Jose were for civil tax examination purposes only, not for a criminal investigation. The record does not indicate that the Examination Division has attempted to disclose the documents to any other IRS division, thereby triggering the five-day notice requirement. Thus, any detrimental impact the district court's order may have on the IRS's investigation is, at this time, purely speculative. Accordingly, the IRS's appeal is not ripe for review.\" Ibid.The dissenting judge concluded that the case was \"ready and ripe\" for decision, id., at 1486, and stated at some length her reasons for believing that the restriction approved by the District Court was unwarranted. The United States and Revenue Agent Nishimura petitioned for certiorari. We called for a response from trustee Jose, but he filed no brief in opposition. We now reverse.\n\n\n6\nWe express no opinion on the merits of the underlying dispute. The matter, indeed, is one that implicates an intercircuit conflict. * We think it clear, however, that the District Court's final order is indeed final. It is a decision dispositively granting in part and denying in part the remedy requested. The IRS prevailed  ]  to the extent that the District Court enforced the summonses. The Service did not prevail to the extent that the District Court imposed a condition--an unqualified requirement that the IRS provide five days' notice to the trustee before transferring summoned information from its Examination Division to any other IRS office. With that disposition, the District Court completed its adjudication. \"We have expressly held that IRS summons enforcement orders are subject to appellate review.\" Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 15, 121 L. Ed. 2d 313, 113 S. Ct. 447 (1992) (citing Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. 440, 449, 11 L. Ed. 2d 459, 84 S. Ct. 508 (1964)). We adhere to that view, and note that appellate jurisdiction over final decisions does not turn on which side prevailed in the District Court.\n\n\n7\nFinality, not ripeness, is the doctrine governing appeals from district court to court of appeals. In this case, to gain access to appeal from the District Court's final decision to the extent that it disfavored the Service, the IRS is not obligated, first, to defy the District Court's order. Nor is the IRS required to provide notice of its intention to transfer documents internally, for this is the very condition the IRS seeks to attack on appeal.\n\n\n8\nThe Court of Appeals cited no authority supporting its cryptic declaration that the conditional enforcement order was not ripe for appeal. We have found none. Indeed, prior to this case, the Ninth Circuit itself had twice upheld similar conditional enforcement orders. See United States v. Zolin, 809 F.2d 1411, 1417 (CA9 1987); United States v. Author Servs., Inc., 804 F.2d 1520, 1525-1526 (CA9 1986). In neither case did the Court of Appeals avoid the merits by interjecting the doctrine of ripeness. Aggrieved by the conditional enforcement upheld in Zolin, the United States petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. We granted the writ, 488 U.S. 907 (1988), and  ]  affirmed the Ninth Circuit's ruling by an equally divided Court, 491 U.S. 554, 561, 105 L. Ed. 2d 469, 109 S. Ct. 2619 (1989). We hardly would have done so had we considered the matter unfit for review.\n\n\n9\nFor the reasons stated, we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment dismissing the appeal, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n10\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n11\n------------------------------Footnotes\n\n\n12\n* Compare United States v. Barrett, 837 F.2d 1341, 1349-1351 (CA5 1988) (en banc) (per curiam) (District Court lacks authority to place conditions on enforcement of IRS summons), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 926, 106 L.

A Federal District Court granted the City's motion to dismiss, and the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Roe's conduct fell within the protected category of citizen commentary on matters of public concern.\nHeld: The City was not barred from terminating Roe. While a government employer may impose restraints on employee speech, the employees have the right to speak on matters of public concern, typically those concerning government policies of interest to the public at large, see Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138; Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563. And when they speak or write on their own time on a topic unrelated to their employment, the speech can have First Amendment protection, absent a governmental justification \"far stronger than mere speculation\" for regulating it. United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 465, 475 (NTEU). Roe's case falls outside the protection afforded by NTEU. Although his activities took place outside the workplace and purported to be about subjects not related to his employment, the City's police department demonstrated that its legitimate and substantial interests were compromised by his speech, and Roe took deliberate steps to link his videos and other wares to his police work. Instead, the case is governed by Pickering, which established a balancing test to reconcile an employee's right to engage in speech and the government employer's right to protect its legitimate concerns, and Connick, which set out a threshold test for determining when Pickering balancing is merited. Because Roe's expression does not qualify as a matter of public concern as this Court's cases have understood that term, he fails the threshold test and Pickering's balancing test does not come into play.\nCertiorari granted; 356 F.3d 1108, reversed.\nON PETITION FOR CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe city of San Diego (City), a petitioner here, terminated a police officer, respondent, for selling videotapes he made and for related activity. The tapes showed the respondent engaging in sexually explicit acts. Respondent brought suit alleging, among other things, that the termination violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California granted the City's motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.\n\n\n2\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n3\n* Respondent John Roe, a San Diego police officer, made a video showing himself stripping off a police uniform and masturbating. He sold the video on the adults-only section of eBay, the popular online auction site. His user name was \"Code3stud@aol.com,\" a word play on a high priority police radio call. 356 F.3d 1108, 1110 (CA9 2004). The uniform apparently was not the specific uniform worn by the San Diego police, but it was clearly identifiable as a police uniform. Roe also sold custom videos, as well as police equipment, including official uniforms of the San Diego Police Department (SDPD), and various other items such as men's underwear. Roe's eBay user profile identified him as employed in the field of law enforcement.\n\n\n4\nRoe's supervisor, a police sergeant, discovered Roe's activities when, while on eBay, he came across an official SDPD police uniform for sale offered by an individual with the user-name \"Code3stud@aol.com.\" He searched for other items Code3stud offered and discovered listings for Roe's videos depicting the objectionable material. Recognizing Roe's picture, the sergeant printed images of certain of Roe's offerings and shared them with others in Roe's chain of command, including a police captain. The captain notified the SDPD's internal affairs department, which began an investigation. In response to a request by an undercover officer, Roe produced a custom video. It showed Roe, again in police uniform, issuing a traffic citation but revoking it after undoing the uniform and masturbating.\n\n\n5\nThe investigation revealed that Roe's conduct violated specific SDPD policies, including conduct unbecoming of an officer, outside employment, and immoral conduct. When confronted, Roe admitted to selling the videos and police paraphernalia. The SDPD ordered Roe to \"cease displaying, manufacturing, distributing or selling any sexually explicit materials or engaging in any similar behaviors, via the internet, U. S. Mail, commercial vendors or distributors, or any other medium available to the public.\" Id., at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although Roe removed some of the items he had offered for sale, he did not change his seller's profile, which described the first two videos he had produced and listed their prices as well as the prices for custom videos. After discovering Roe's failure to follow its orders, the SDPD—citing Roe for the added violation of disobedience of lawful orders—began termination proceedings. The proceedings resulted in Roe's dismissal from the police force.\n\n\n6\nRoe brought suit in the District Court pursuant to Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging that the employment termination violated his First Amendment right to free speech. In granting the City's motion to dismiss, the District Court decided that Roe had not demonstrated that selling official police uniforms and producing, marketing, and selling sexually explicit videos for profit qualified as expression relating to a matter of \"public concern\" under this Court's decision in Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983).\n\n\n7\nIn reversing, the Court of Appeals held Roe's conduct fell within the protected category of citizen commentary on matters of public concern. Central to the Court of Appeals' conclusion was that Roe's expression was not an internal workplace grievance, took place while he was off duty and away from his employer's premises, and was unrelated to his employment. 356 F.3d, at 1110, 1113-1114.\n\nII\n\n8\nA government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment. See, e. g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605-606 (1967). On the other hand, a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees, restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public. The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on matters of public concern, typically matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large, a subject on which public employees are uniquely qualified to comment. See Connick, supra; Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968). Outside of this category, the Court has held that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics unrelated to their employment, the speech can have First Amendment protection, absent some governmental justification \"far stronger than mere speculation\" in regulating it. United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 465, 475 (1995) (NTEU). We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases.\n\n\n9\n* In concluding that Roe's activities qualified as a matter of public concern, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Court's decision in NTEU. 356 F.3d, at 1117. In NTEU it was established that the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission and purpose of the employer. The question was whether the Federal Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees. The Court held that, within the particular classification of employment, the Government had shown no justification for the outside salary limitations. The First Amendment right of the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for such activities. The Court noted that throughout history public employees who undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial contributions to literature and art, 513 U. S., at 465, and observed that none of the speech at issue \"even arguably [had] any adverse impact\" on the employer, ibid.\n\n\n10\nThe Court of Appeals' reliance on NTEU was seriously misplaced. Although Roe's activities took place outside the workplace and purported to be about subjects not related to his employment, the SDPD demonstrated legitimate and substantial interests of its own that were compromised by his speech. Far from confining his activities to speech unrelated to his employment, Roe took deliberate steps to link his videos and other wares to his police work, all in a way injurious to his employer. The use of the uniform, the law enforcement reference in the Web site, the listing of the speaker as \"in the field of law enforcement,\" and the debased parody of an officer performing indecent acts while in the course of official duties brought the mission of the employer and the professionalism of its officers into serious disrepute. 356 F. 3d, at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n11\nThe Court of Appeals noted the City conceded Roe's activities were \"unrelated\" to his employment. Id., at 1112, n. 4. In the context of the pleadings and arguments, the proper interpretation of the City's statement is simply to underscore the obvious proposition that Roe's speech was not a comment on the workings or functioning of the SDPD. It is quite a different question whether the speech was detrimental to the SDPD. On that score the City's consistent position has been that the speech is contrary to its regulations and harmful to the proper functioning of the police force. The present case falls outside the protection afforded in NTEU. The authorities that instead control, and which are considered below, are this Court's decisions in Pickering, supra, Connick, supra, and the decisions which follow them.\n\nB\n\n12\nTo reconcile the employee's right to engage in speech and the government employer's right to protect its own legitimate interests in performing its mission, the Pickering Court adopted a balancing test. It requires a court evaluating restraints on a public employee's speech to balance \"the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\" 391 U. S., at 568; see also Connick, supra, at 142.\n\n\n13\nUnderlying the decision in Pickering is the recognition that public employees are often the members of the community who are likely to have informed opinions as to the operations of their public employers, operations which are of substantial concern to the public. Were they not able to speak on these matters, the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public issues. See 391 U. S., at 572. The interest at stake is as much the public's interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee's own right to disseminate it.\n\n\n14\nPickering did not hold that any and all statements by a public employee are entitled to balancing. To require Pickering balancing in every case where speech by a public employee is at issue, no matter the content of the speech, could compromise the proper functioning of government offices. See Connick, 461 U. S., at 143. This concern prompted the Court in Connick to explain a threshold inquiry (implicit in Pickering itself) that in order to merit Pickering balancing, a public employee's speech must touch on a matter of \"public concern.\" 461 U. S., at 143 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n15\nIn Connick, an assistant district attorney, unhappy with her supervisor's decision to transfer her to another division, circulated an intraoffice questionnaire. The document solicited her co-workers' views on, inter alia, office transfer policy, office morale, the need for grievance committees, the level of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns. See id., at 141.\n\n\n16\nFinding that—with the exception of the final question—the questionnaire touched not on matters of public concern but on internal workplace grievances, the Court held no Pickering balancing was required. 461 U. S., at 141. To conclude otherwise would ignore the \"common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.\" Id., at 143. Connick held that a public employee's speech is entitled to Pickering balancing only when the employee speaks \"as a citizen upon matters of public concern\" rather than \"as an employee upon matters only of personal interest.\" 461 U. S., at 147.\n\n\n17\nAlthough the boundaries of the public concern test are not well defined, Connick provides some guidance. It directs courts to examine the \"content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record\" in assessing whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern. Id., at 146-147. In addition, it notes that the standard for determining whether expression is of public concern is the same standard used to determine whether a common-law action for invasion of privacy is present. Id., at 143, n. 5. That standard is established by our decisions in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469 (1975), and Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 387-388 (1967). These cases make clear that public concern is something that is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public at the time of publication. The Court has also recognized that certain private remarks, such as negative comments about the President of the United States, touch on matters of public concern and should thus be subject to Pickering balancing. See Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U. S. 378 (1987).\n\n\n18\nApplying these principles to the instant case, there is no difficulty in concluding that Roe's expression does not qualify as a matter of public concern under any view of the public concern test. He fails the threshold test and Pickering balancing does not come into play.\n\n\n19\nConnick is controlling precedent, but to show why this is not a close case it is instructive to note that even under the view expressed by the dissent in Connick from four Members of the Court, the speech here would not come within the definition of a matter of public concern. The dissent in Connick would have held that the entirety of the questionnaire circulated by the employee \"discussed subjects that could reasonably be expected to be of interest to persons seeking to develop informed opinions about the manner in which . . . an elected official charged with managing a vital governmental agency, discharges his responsibilities.\" 461 U. S., at 163 (opinion of Brennan, J.). No similar purpose could be attributed to the employee's speech in the present case. Roe's activities did nothing to inform the public about any aspect of the SDPD's functioning or operation. Nor were Roe's activities anything like the private remarks at issue in Rankin, where one co-worker commented to another co-worker on an item of political news. Roe's expression was widely broadcast, linked to his official status as a police officer, and designed to exploit his employer's image.\n\n\n20\nThe speech in question was detrimental to the mission and functions of the employer. There is no basis for finding that it was of concern to the community as the Court's cases have understood that term in the context of restrictions by governmental entities on the speech of their employees.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n21\n\nReversed.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Each filed a petition for review in the Second Circuit pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1) and a habeas corpus petition in the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in order to challenge the Board of Immigration Appeals' determination that, as a matter of law, they were ineligible to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation under former §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Second Circuit dismissed their petitions for lack of jurisdiction, holding that they could nevertheless pursue their claims in a §2241 action in district court.\n\nHeld: The Second Circuit lacked jurisdiction to hear the petitions for direct review, but petitioners can proceed with their habeas petitions if they wish to obtain relief. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) expressly precludes courts of appeals from exercising jurisdiction to review a final removal order against an alien removable by reason of a conviction for, inter alia, an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C). This plain language explicitly strips the courts of appeals of the ability to hear petitioners' claims on direct review. However, because Congress has not spoken with sufficient clarity to strip the district courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions raising identical claims, see INS v. St. Cyr, ante, at ___, petitioners may pursue their claims in a §2241 action.

They conceded that they are deportable based upon their past criminal convictions, but each filed both a petition for review in the Second Circuit pursuant to 8 U.S. C. §1252(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V) and a habeas corpus petition in the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in order to challenge the Board of Immigration Appeals' determination that, as a matter of law, petitioners were ineligible to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation under former §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 182, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994 ed.). Their petitions for review were consolidated in the Court of Appeals, which subsequently dismissed the petitions for lack of jurisdiction, holding that petitioners could nevertheless pursue their constitutional and statutory claims in a district court habeas action brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. 232 F.3d 328 (CA2 2000). We granted certiorari in this case, 531 U.S. 1108 (2001), and in INS v. St. Cyr, No. 00 767, 531 U.S. 1107 (2001), in order to comprehensively consider whether aliens in the petitioners' position may seek relief in the Court of Appeals (pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1)); in the district court (pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241); or not at all. For the reasons stated below and in our opinion in INS v. St. Cyr, ante, p.__, we agree with the Court of Appeals that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the petitions for direct review at issue in this case and that petitioners must, therefore, proceed with their petitions for habeas corpus if they wish to obtain relief.\n\n\n2\nAs part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009 546, Congress adopted new provisions governing the judicial review of immigration orders. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (codifying these procedures). Like the prior statute, the new provision vests the courts of appeals with the authority to consider petitions challenging \"final orders\" commanding the \"removal\" of aliens from the United States. §1252(a)(1).1 However, unlike the previous provisions, the new statute expressly precludes the courts of appeals from exercising \"jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against any alien who is removable by reason of \" a conviction for certain criminal offenses, including any aggravated felony. §1252(a)(2)(C).2\n\n\n3\nAs petitioners in this case were convicted of \"aggravated felonies\" within the meaning of the relevant statutes,3 the plain language of §1252(a)(2)(C) fairly explicitly strips the courts of appeals of jurisdiction to hear their claims on petitions for direct review. Without much discussion, the Court of Appeals so held. 232 F.3d, at 342 343.\n\n\n4\nBefore this Court, petitioners primarily argue that constitutional considerations and background principles of statutory interpretation require that they be afforded some forum for the adjudication of the merits of their claims. They devote the bulk of their briefs to arguing that the Court of Appeals motivated by these concerns properly interpreted IIRIRA's jurisdiction-stripping provision not to preclude aliens such as petitioners from pursuing habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Brief for Petitioners 12 42, 44 49. In the alternative, they argue that we might construe the same provisions as stripping jurisdiction from the courts of appeals over only some matters, leaving in place their jurisdiction to directly review petitions raising claims previously cognizable under §2241. Id., at 42 44.\n\n\n5\nWe agree with petitioners that leaving aliens without a forum for adjudicating claims such as those raised in this case would raise serious constitutional questions. We also agree with petitioners and the Court of Appeals that these concerns can best be alleviated by construing the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of that statute not to preclude aliens such as petitioners from pursuing habeas relief pursuant to §2241. See St. Cyr, ante, at __.\n\n\n6\nFinding no support in the text or history of §1252 for concluding that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to hear petitions such as those brought in this case, but concluding that Congress has not spoken with sufficient clarity to strip the district courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions raising identical claims, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in all particulars.\n\n\n7\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n8\nO'Connor, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n9\nScalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Thomas, J., joined.\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n1\n  An additional difference between the old and the new statute with regard to petitions for review is one of nomenclature. In keeping with a statute-wide change in terminology, the new provision refers to orders of \"removal\" rather than orders of \"deportation\" or \"exclusion.\" Compare 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V), with §1105a (1994 ed.).\n\n\n2\n  The scope of this preclusion is not entirely clear. Though the text of the provision is quite broad, it is not without its ambiguities. Throughout this litigation, the government has conceded that the courts of appeals have the power to hear petitions challenging the factual determinations thought to trigger the jurisdiction-stripping provision (such as whether an individual is an alien and whether he or she has been convicted of an \"aggravated felony\" within the meaning of the statute). See Brief for Respondent 22 23. In addition, the government has also conceded that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to review \"substantial constitutional challenges\" raised by aliens who come within the strictures of §1252(a)(2)(C). See id., at 23 24. As the petitions in this case do not raise any of these types of issues, we need not address this point further. Nonetheless, it remains instructive that the government acknowledges that background principles of statutory construction and constitutional concerns must be considered in determining the scope of IIRIRA's jurisdiction-stripping provisions.\n\n\n3\n  All three petitioners were convicted of controlled substance offenses for which they served between four months and four years in prison. Each concedes that his or her crime is an \"aggravated felony\" as defined in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), which renders him or her removable pursuant to §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n\n\n\n10\nJustice O'Connor, dissenting.\n\n\n11\nFor the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in the companion case of INS v.

Bertollt, etc.\nNo. 94-197.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nFeb. 22, 1995.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nUnder Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), 49 Stat. 627, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 601 et seq., the Federal Government partially reimburses States for welfare programs that either comply with all federal prescriptions or receive a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).  42 U.S.C. § 1315.  California seeks to change its AFDC program by limiting new residents, for the first year they live in California, to the benefits paid in the State from which they came.  See Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code Ann. § 11450.03 (West Supp.1994).  Green and other new residents who receive AFDC benefits challenged the constitutionality of this California statute in a federal court action;  they maintain that the payment differential between new and long-term residents burdens interstate migration and thus violates the right to travel recognized in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), and its progeny.  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California enjoined the payment differential, Green v. Anderson, 811 F.Supp. 516, 523 (1993), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  Green v. Anderson, 26 F.3d 95 (1994).  We granted California's petition for certiorari. 513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 306, 130 L.Ed.2d 218 (1994).  We now find, however, that no justiciable controversy is before us, because the case in its current posture is not ripe.\n\n\n2\nThe California statute provides that the payment differential shall not take effect absent receipt by the State of an HHS waiver.  See Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code Ann. § 11450.03(b) (West Supp.1994).  HHS originally granted a waiver, which was in effect when the District Court and Court of Appeals ruled.  But \"ripeness is peculiarly a question of timing,\" and \"it is the situation now rather than the situation at the time of the [decision under review] that must govern.\"  Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 140, 95 S.Ct. 335, 357, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974).  After the Court of Appeals ruled in this case, it vacated the HHS waiver in a separate proceeding, concluding that the Secretary had not adequately considered objections to California's program.  Beno v. Shalala, 30 F.3d 1057, 1073-1076 (CA9 1994). The Secretary did not seek this Court's review of the Beno decision.  California acknowledges that even if it prevails here, the payment differential will not take effect.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-6.  Absent favorable action by HHS on a renewed application for a waiver, California will continue to treat Green and others similarly situated the same way it treats long-term California residents.  The parties have no live dispute now, and whether one will arise in the future is conjectural.  See Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 90 S.Ct. 200, 24 L.Ed.2d 214 (1969) (per curiam ) (after this Court noted probable jurisdiction, Colorado legislature reduced to two months challenged six-month residency requirement for voting in presidential elections;  revival of controversy consequently became too speculative to warrant Court's passing on substantive issues).\n\n\n3\nIn view of the impediment to dispositive adjudication, we direct the vacation of prior judgments in this case.  As we explained earlier this Term, in deciding whether to disturb prior judgments in a case rendered nonjusticiable, we have inquired, pivotally, \"whether the party seeking relief from the judgment below caused the [nonjusticiability] by voluntary action.\"  U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 386, 391, 130 L.Ed.2d 233 (1994).  Unlike settlement, see ibid., or a losing party's decision to forgo appeal, see Karcher v. May, 484 U.S. 72, 83, 108 S.Ct. 388, 395, 98 L.Ed.2d 327 (1987), California's loss of the federal approval necessary to implement its program was not voluntary.  Vacatur is appropriate, therefore, to \"clea[r] the path for future relitigation of the issues between parties and [to] eliminat[e] a judgment, review of which was prevented through happenstance.\" United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 40, 71 S.Ct. 104, 107, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950).\n\n\n4\nAccordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court with directions to order the vacation of the District Court's judgment and the dismissal of the case.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

ZANT, Warden.\nNo. 92-5579.\nDecided Jan. 19, 1993.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.\n\n\n2\nA Georgia jury found petitioner Wilburn Dobbs guilty of murder and sentenced him to death.  In his first federal habeas petition, petitioner claimed, inter alia, that he received ineffective assistance from his court-appointed counsel at sentencing.  The District Court rejected this claim after holding an evidentiary hearing.  Because a transcript of the closing arguments made at sentencing was, by the State's representation, unavailable, the District Court relied on the testimony of petitioner's counsel regarding the content of his closing argument to find that counsel had rendered effective assistance.  Civ. Action No. 80-247 (ND Ga., Jan. 13, 1984), p. 24.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, also relying on counsel's testimony about his closing argument in mitigation. Dobbs v. Kemp, 790 F.2d 1499, 1514, and n. 15 (1986).\n\n\n3\nSubsequently, petitioner located a transcript of the penalty phase closing arguments, which flatly contradicted the account given by counsel in key respects.  Petitioner moved the Court of Appeals, now reviewing related proceedings from the District Court, to supplement the record on appeal with the sentencing transcript.  The court denied this motion without explanation. No. 90-8352 (CA11, Nov. 1, 1990).\n\n\n4\nAffirming the District Court's denial of relief on other claims, the Eleventh Circuit held that the law of the case doctrine prevented it from revisiting its prior rejection of petitioner's ineffective assistance claim.  The court acknowledged the manifest injustice exception to law of the case, but refused to apply the exception, reasoning that its denial of leave to supplement the record left petitioner unable to show an injustice. 963 F.2d 1403, 1409 (1991).\n\n\n5\nWe hold that the Court of Appeals erred when it refused to consider the full sentencing transcript.  We have emphasized before the importance of reviewing capital sentences on a complete record.  Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 361, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1206, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977) (plurality opinion).  Cf. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 167, 198, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2922, 2936, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (Georgia capital sentencing provision requiring transmittal on appeal of complete transcript and record is important \"safeguard against arbitrariness and caprice\").  In this case, the Court of Appeals offered no justification for its decision to exclude the transcript from consideration.  There can be no doubt as to the transcript's relevance, for it calls into serious question the factual predicate on which the District Court and Court of Appeals relied in deciding petitioner's ineffective assistance claim.  As the Court of Appeals itself acknowledged, its refusal to review the transcript left it unable to apply the manifest injustice exception to the law of the case doctrine, and hence unable to determine whether its prior decision should be reconsidered.1\n\n\n6\nOn the facts of this case, exclusion of the transcript cannot be justified by the delay in its discovery.  That delay resulted substantially from the State's own erroneous assertions that closing arguments had not been transcribed.  As the District Court found:  \"[T]he entire transcript should have been made available for Dobbs' direct appeal, and the State represented to this Court that the sentencing phase closing arguments could not be transcribed.  Dobbs' position that he legitimately relied on the State's representation is well taken.\"  Civ. Action No. 80-247 (ND Ga., Mar. 6, 1990), p. 4.\n\n\n7\nWe hold that, under the particular circumstances described above, the Court of Appeals erred by refusing to consider the sentencing hearing transcript.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n8\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n9\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice WHITE would grant certiorari and give the case plenary consideration.\n\n\n10\nJustice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n11\nToday's judgment reverses the decision below on the grounds that, in deciding not to apply the \"manifest injustice\" exception to the law of the case, the Court of Appeals wrongfully failed to consider a newly discovered transcript from petitioner's trial. The judgment is correct, but the judgment is also not worth making, serving no purpose but to extend the scandalous delay in the execution of a death sentence lawfully pronounced more than 18 years ago.\n\n\n12\nAs a general matter, I agree with Justice STEVENS' frequently recited view that \"[i]t is not appropriate for this Court to expend its scarce resources crafting opinions that correct technical errors in cases of only local importance where the correction in no way promotes the development of the law.\" Anderson v. Harless, 459 U.S. 4, 12, 103 S.Ct. 276, 280, 74 L.Ed.2d 3 (1982) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  \" 'To remain effective, the Supreme Court must continue to decide only those cases which present questions whose resolution will have immediate importance far beyond the particular facts and parties involved.' \"  Board of Ed. of Rogers, Ark. v. McCluskey, 458 U.S. 966, 971, 102 S.Ct. 3469, 3472, 73 L.Ed.2d 1273 (1982) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (quoting Address of Chief Justice Vinson before the American Bar Association, September 7, 1949).  I am willing to make an exception from that rule in capital cases—but only where there is a realistic likelihood that the \"technical error\" affected the conviction or the sentence.  Here that is fanciful.\n\n\n13\nTo begin with, the rediscovered transcript covers only the closing statements in the case, and petitioner's claim goes only to the fact that his trial counsel made one rather than two arguments in closing.  It would be a rare case in which the omission of one particular argument from an attorney's closing statement would be dispositive of an ineffective assistance claim. It is simply not true, moreover, that the transcript \"flatly contradict[s],\" ante, at 835, the testimony of petitioner's trial counsel in the initial habeas hearing—or at least not true in the sense that it shows trial counsel was lying.  The transcript confirms that, as trial counsel recalled, he had argued that the death penalty was inappropriate in any circumstance.  In fact, he read to the jury large portions of Justice Brennan's opinion in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), which is certainly an eloquent argument that the death penalty is improper in any case.  The transcript does reveal that counsel had not argued in mitigation that the killing was impulsive—which, petitioner now claims, shows that counsel's prior testimony was \"false,\" Pet. for Cert. 19.  That is not so. Although counsel stated at one point that he was \"sure\" he had argued the impulsive-killing point, a few lines earlier in the transcript he had said that \"I would assume that I argued [it]\" (emphasis added), and had made clear that \"a lot of this is really not from actual recollection.\"  Tr. 70-71 (Nov. 10, 1982). Petitioner's habeas counsel understood the import of this, describing (in his post-hearing brief) trial counsel's testimony to have been that \"he probably argued that the killing was impulsive and not planned.\"  Petitioner's Post-Hearing Brief in No. C80-247R (ND Ga., Dec. 2, 1982), p. 25, n. 6 (emphasis added); see also Objections to Magistrate's Report and Recommendation in No. C80-247R (ND Ga., Sept. 12, 1983), p. 8, n. 1 (same).\n\n\n14\nThere is absolutely zero likelihood that counsel's misrecollection (or misreconstruction) that he had made an \"impulsiveness\" argument to the jury made the difference in the 1986 finding that his assistance was not ineffective. Petitioner's ineffectiveness contention had not been directed to the inadequacy of counsel's closing argument, but rather to his failure to introduce mitigating evidence—character witnesses and the like—during the sentencing phase.  See Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (Dec. 3, 1980), ¶ 49, p. 12, Petitioner's Post-Hearing Brief (Dec. 2, 1982), pp. 17-30, Magistrate's Report and Recommendation (Aug. 26, 1983), pp. 8-18, and Objections to the Magistrate's Report and Recommendation (Sept. 12, 1983), pp. 2-12, in No. C80-247R (ND Ga.);  Dobbs v. Kemp, 790 F.2d 1499, 1513 (CA11 1986), modified in part, 809 F.2d 750 (CA11 1987).  In addressing that contention, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals relied on the content of the closing argument, for the obvious reason that it does not constitute evidence.  The District Court described the closing argument in setting forth the events of the sentencing phase, but did not mention it in its legal analysis, ruling instead that counsel had made a \"reasonably substantial investigation\" in searching for witnesses to testify on petitioner's behalf and a \"reasonable tactical decision not to present evidence based on the information before him.\"  Dobbs v. Zant, No. C80-247R (ND Ga., Jan. 13, 1984), p. 25.  In affirming the District Court, the Court of Appeals elaborated on what it thought was the crucial \"tactical decision\" of the trial counsel (which was not a decision to omit evidence of mitigation in favor of a stunning closing argument):  \"Knowing of [petitioner's] poor reputation in the community, [counsel] testified in the district court that he did not want to put on any 'positive' character testimony for fear that it would not be persuasive and would prompt damaging counter evidence from the prosecution.\"  Dobbs v. Kemp, 790 F.2d, at 1513-1514.  The closing argument was mentioned only in a footnote, which stated:  \"Although [counsel] did not present any mitigating evidence, his testimony in the district court reveals that he did make a closing argument in mitigation.\" Id., at 1514, n. 15.\n\n\n15\nI think it unimaginable that, if this transcript had been available in 1986—showing that only Justice Brennan's moving Furman argument, and not also an \"impulsiveness\" argument had been made—the Court of Appeals would have found that there was ineffective assistance of counsel.  (Indeed, if it were our practice to correct technical errors I would vote to reverse a finding that assistance otherwise effective was rendered ineffective by that omission.)  But I think it soars beyond the unimaginable, into the wildly delirious, to believe that the Court of Appeals will find that the newly discovered transcript demonstrates such \"manifest injustice\" that it warrants making an exception to the law-of-the-case doctrine, so that the already-decided ineffectiveness question should be reopened. There was, in short, no reason to grant this petition and correct this (admittedly clear) technical error, except to place another obstacle in the way of a death penalty that has been suspended within this Court's \"death-is-different\" time warp since 1974.\n\n\n\n1\n The concurrence suggests, post, at 837-838, that the error in this case, limited in scope to closing arguments at the penalty phase, is likely insignificant.  In fact, an inadequate or harmful closing argument, when combined, as here, with a failure to present mitigating evidence, may be highly relevant to the ineffective assistance determination under Eleventh Circuit law.

S. C. § 922(g)(1) from possessing, distributing, or receiving firearms or ammunition. Relying on § 925(c), he applied to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) for relief from his firearms disabilities. ATF returned the application unprocessed, explaining that its annual appropriations law forbade it from expending any funds to investigate or act upon such applications. Invoking § 925(c)'s judicial review provision, he filed suit, asking the District Court to conduct its own inquiry into his fitness to possess a gun and to issue a judicial order granting relief. The court granted the requested relief, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The absence of an actual denial by ATF of a felon's petition precludes judicial review under § 925(c). The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to grant relief from a firearms disability if certain preconditions are met, and an applicant may seek federal-court review if the Secretary denies his application. Ibid. Since 1992, however, the appropriations bar has prevented ATF, to which the Secretary has delegated this authority, from using appropriated funds to investigate or act upon the applications. Section 925(c)'s text and the procedure it lays out for seeking relief make clear that an actual decision by ATF on an application is a prerequisite for judicial review, and that mere inaction by ATF does not invest a district court with independent jurisdiction. Grammatically, the phrase \"denied by the Secretary\" references the Secretary's decision on whether an applicant \"will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety,\" and whether \"the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest.\" Such determination can hardly be construed as anything but a decision actually denying the application. Under § 925(c)'s procedure for those seeking relief, the Secretary, i. e., ATF, has broad authority to grant or deny relief, even when the statutory prerequisites are satisfied. This procedure shows that judicial review cannot occur without a dispositive decision by ATF. First, in the absence of a statutorily defined standard of review for action under § 925(c), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) supplies the applicable standard. 5 U. S. C. §§ 701(a), 706(2)(A). The APA's \"arbitrary and capricious\" test, by its nature, contemplates review of some action by another entity. Second, both parts of § 925(c)'s standard for granting relief—whether an applicant is \"likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety\" and whether the relief is in the \"public interest\" — are policy-based determinations and, hence, point to ATF as the primary decisionmaker. Third, § 925(c) allows the admission of additional evidence in district court proceedings only in exceptional circumstances. Congressional assignment of such a circumscribed role to a district court shows that the statute contemplates that a court's determination will heavily rely on the record and the ATF's decision. Indeed, the very use in § 925(c) of the word \"review\" to describe a court's responsibility in this statutory scheme signifies that it cannot grant relief on its own, absent an antecedent actual denial by ATF. Pp. 74-78.\n253 F. 3d 234, reversed.\nTHOMAS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.\nDeputy Solicitor General Kneedler argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Olson, Assistant Attorney General McCallum, Irving L. Gornstein, Mark B. Stern, and Thomas M. Bondy.\nThomas C. Goldstein argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Larry C. Hunter and Amy Howe.*\nJUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe consider in this case whether, despite appropriation provisions barring the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) from acting on applications for relief from firearms disabilities of persons convicted of a felony, a federal district court has authority under 18 U. S. C. § 925(c) to grant such relief.\n\n\n2\n* After attending a gun show in Laredo, Texas, respondent, Thomas Lamar Bean, a gun dealer, and his associates drove respondent's vehicle to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, for dinner. Bean v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 253 F. 3d 234, 236 (CA5 2001). When Mexican officials stopped the vehicle at the border, they found in the back, in plain view, approximately 200 rounds of ammunition. Ibid. According to respondent, he had instructed his associates to remove any firearms and ammunition from his vehicle, but inexplicably one box remained. Ibid. Respondent was convicted in a Mexican court of importing ammunition into Mexico and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.\n\n\n3\nBecause of his felony conviction, respondent was prohibited by 18 U. S. C. § 922(g)(1) from possessing, distributing, or receiving firearms or ammunition. Relying on § 925(c), respondent applied to ATF for relief from his firearms disabilities. ATF returned the application unprocessed, explaining that its annual appropriations law forbade it from expending any funds to investigate or act upon applications such as respondent's.\n\n\n4\nRespondent then filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Relying on the judicial review provision in § 925(c), respondent asked the District Court to conduct its own inquiry into his fitness to possess a gun, and to issue a judicial order granting relief from his firearms disabilities. Respondent attached various affidavits from persons attesting to his fitness to possess firearms. After conducting a hearing, the court entered judgment granting respondent the requested relief. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, concluding that congressional refusal to provide funding to ATF for reviewing applications such as respondent's \"is not the requisite direct and definite suspension or repeal of the subject rights.\" 253 F. 3d, at 239. The Fifth Circuit then proceeded to hold that the District Court had jurisdiction to review ATF's (in)action. We granted certiorari. 534 U. S. 1112 (2002).\n\nII\n\n5\nUnder federal law, a person who is convicted of a felony is prohibited from possessing firearms. See § 922(g)(1). The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to grant relief from that prohibition if it is established to his satisfaction that certain preconditions are met. See § 925(c).1 An applicant may seek judicial review from a \"United States district court\" if his application \"is denied by the Secretary.\" Ibid.\n\n\n6\nSince 1992, however, the appropriations bar has prevented ATF, to which the Secretary has delegated authority to act on § 925(c) applications,2 from using \"funds appropriated herein . . . to investigate or act upon applications for relief from Federal firearms disabilities under 18 U. S. C. [§]925(c).\" Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1993, Pub. L. 102-393, 106 Stat. 1732.3 Accordingly, ATF, upon receipt of respondent's petition, returned it, explaining that \"[s]ince October 1992, ATF's annual appropriation has prohibited the expending of any funds to investigate or act upon applications for relief from Federal firearms disabilities.\" App. 33-34. Respondent contends that ATF's failure to act constitutes a \"denial\" within the meaning of § 925(c), and that, therefore, district courts have jurisdiction to review such inaction.\n\n\n7\nWe disagree. Inaction by ATF does not amount to a \"denial\" within the meaning of § 925(c). The text of § 925(c) and the procedure it lays out for seeking relief make clear that an actual decision by ATF on an application is a prerequisite for judicial review, and that mere inaction by ATF does not invest a district court with independent jurisdiction to act on an application.\n\n\n8\nGrammatically, the phrase \"denied by the Secretary\" references the Secretary's decision on whether an applicant \"will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety,\" and whether \"the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest.\" The determination whether an applicant is \"likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety\" can hardly be construed as anything but a decision actually denying the application.4 And, in fact, respondent does not contend that ATF actually passed on his application, but rather claims that \"refusal to grant relief constitutes a literal, or at least a constructive, denial of the application because it has precisely the same impact on [the applicant] as denial on the merits.\" Brief for Respondent 35 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n\n9\nThe procedure that § 925(c) lays out for those seeking relief also leads us to conclude that an actual adverse action on the application by ATF is a prerequisite for judicial review. Section 925(c) requires an applicant, as a first step, to petition the Secretary and establish to the Secretary's satisfaction that the applicant is eligible for relief. The Secretary, in his discretion, may grant or deny the request based on the broad considerations outlined above. Only then, if the Secretary denies relief, may an applicant seek review in a district court.\n\n\n10\nThis broad authority of the Secretary, i. e., ATF, to grant or deny relief, even when the statutory prerequisites are satisfied, shows that judicial review under § 925(c) cannot occur without a dispositive decision by ATF. First, in the absence of a statutorily defined standard of review for action under § 925(c), the APA supplies the applicable standard. 5 U. S. C. § 701(a). Under the APA, judicial review is usually limited to determining whether agency action is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" § 706(2)(A). Application of the APA standard of review here indicates that judicial review is predicated upon ATF's dispositive decision: the \"arbitrary and capricious\" test in its nature contemplates review of some action by another entity, rather than initial judgment of the court itself.\n\n\n11\nSecond, both parts of the standard for granting relief point to ATF as the primary decisionmaker. Whether an applicant is \"likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety\" presupposes an inquiry into that applicant's background—a function best performed by the Executive, which, unlike courts, is institutionally equipped for conducting a neutral, wide-ranging investigation. Similarly, the \"public interest\" standard calls for an inherently policy-based decision best left in the hands of an agency.\n\n\n12\nThird, the admission of additional evidence in district court proceedings is contemplated only in exceptional circumstances. See 18 U. S. C. § 925(c) (allowing, \"in [district court's] discretion,\" admission of evidence where \"failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice\"). Congressional assignment of such a circumscribed role to a district court shows that the statute contemplates that a district court's determination will heavily rely on the record and the decision made by ATF. Indeed, the very use in § 925(c) of the word \"review\" to describe a district court's responsibility in this statutory scheme signifies that a district court cannot grant relief on its own, absent an antecedent actual denial by ATF.\n\n\n13\nAccordingly, we hold that the absence of an actual denial of respondent's petition by ATF precludes judicial review under § 925(c), and therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n14\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Craig Goldblatt and Mathew S. Nosanchuk filed a brief for the Violence Policy Center as amicus curiae urging reversal.\nBriefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, Inc., by Richard E. Gardiner; and for the Second Amendment Foundation by William M. Gustavson.\n\n\n1\n Title 18 U. S. C. § 925(c) provides:\n\"A person who is prohibited from possessing, shipping, transporting, or receiving firearms or ammunition may make application to the Secretary for relief from the disabilities imposed by Federal laws with respect to the acquisition, receipt, transfer, shipment, transportation, or possession of firearms, and the Secretary may grant such relief if it is established to his satisfaction that the circumstances regarding the disability, and the applicant's record and reputation, are such that the applicant will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest. Any person whose application for relief from disabilities is denied by the Secretary may file a petition with the United States district court for the district in which he resides for a judicial review of such denial. The court may in its discretion admit additional evidence where failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice. A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector conducting operations under this chapter, who makes application for relief from the disabilities incurred under this chapter, shall not be barred by such disability from further operations under his license pending final action on an application for relief filed pursuant to this section. Whenever the Secretary grants relief to any person pursuant to this section he shall promptly publish in the Federal Register notice of such action, together with the reasons therefor.\"\n\n\n2\n Respondent contends that congressional denial of funds to ATF did not eliminate the Secretary's power to act on his application. In support, respondent notes that § 925(c) refers to the action by \"the Secretary.\" That claim, however, is waived, as respondent raised it for the first time in his brief on the merits to this Court\nEven if considered on the merits, respondent's argument faces several difficulties. First, it appears that the Secretary delegated to ATF the exclusive authority to act on petitions brought under § 925(c), see 27 CFR §§ 178.144(b) and (d) (2002); such delegation is not unreasonable. Second, even assuming the Secretary has retained the authority to act on such petitions, it is not clear that respondent would prevail were he to file a requisite action under 5 U. S. C. § 706(1) (providing for judicial review to \"compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed\"). Not only does the Secretary, by the explicit terms of the statute, possess broad discretion as to whether to grant relief, see infra, at 76-78, but congressional withholding of funds from ATF would likely inform his exercise of discretion.\n\n\n3\n In each subsequent year, Congress has retained the bar on the use of appropriated funds to process applications filed by individuals. Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2002, Pub. L. 107-67, 115 Stat. 519; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106-554, 114 Stat. 2763A-129; Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000, Pub. L. 106-58, 113 Stat. 434; Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, Pub.

S. C. § 551(13), an applicant may obtain judicial review under § 925(c) only if an application is denied. See 2A N.

The bank moved to compel arbitration as provided in the parties' debt-restructuring agreements. The court ordered respondents to submit to arbitration, but the State Supreme Court reversed, finding that, because the agreements had no substantial effect on interstate commerce, there was an insufficient nexus with such commerce to establish Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) coverage of the parties' dispute.\nHeld: There is sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to make the arbitration provision enforceable under the FAA. By applying to a contract \"evidencing a transaction involving commerce,\" 9 U. S. C. § 2, the FAA provides for \"the enforcement of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the Commerce Clause,\" Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 490. It is thus perfectly clear that the FAA encompasses a wider range of transactions than those actually \"in commerce.\" Although the debt-restructuring agreements were executed in Alabama by Alabama residents, they nonetheless satisfy the FAA's \"involving commerce\" test. First, Alafabco engaged in business throughout the southeastern United States, using substantial loans from the bank that were renegotiated and redocumented in the debt-restructuring agreements. Second, the restructured debt was secured by all of Alafabco's business assets, including its inventory of goods assembled from out-of-state parts and raw materials. Third, commercial lending has a broad impact on the national economy. The Alabama Supreme Court's cramped view of Congress' Commerce Clause power appears to rest on a misreading of United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, which does not suggest that limits on the power to regulate commerce are breached by applying the FAA to disputes arising out of commercial loan transactions such as these.\nCertiorari granted; reversed and remanded.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe question presented is whether the parties' debt-restructuring agreement is \"a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\" within the meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). 9 U. S. C. § 2. As we concluded in Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265 (1995), there is a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to make enforceable, pursuant to the FAA, an arbitration provision included in that agreement.\n\n\n2\n* Petitioner The Citizens Bank—an Alabama lending institution—seeks to compel arbitration of a financial dispute with respondents Alafabco, Inc.—an Alabama fabrication and construction company—and its officers. According to a complaint filed by respondents in Alabama state court, the dispute among the parties arose out of a series of commercial loan transactions made over a decade-long course of business dealings. In 1986, the complaint alleges, the parties entered into a quasi-contractual relationship in which the bank agreed to provide operating capital necessary for Alafabco to secure and complete construction contracts. That relationship began to sour in 1998, when the bank allegedly encouraged Alafabco to bid on a large construction contract in Courtland, Alabama, but refused to provide the capital necessary to complete the project. In order to compensate for the bank's alleged breach of the parties' implied agreement, Alafabco completed the Courtland project with funds that would otherwise have been dedicated to repaying existing obligations to the bank. Alafabco in turn became delinquent in repaying those existing obligations.\n\n\n3\nOn two occasions, the parties attempted to resolve the outstanding debts. On May 3, 1999, Alafabco and the bank executed \"`renewal notes'\" in which all previous loans were restructured and redocumented. 872 So. 2d 798 (Ala. 2002). The debt-restructuring arrangement included an arbitration agreement covering \"`all disputes, claims, or controversies.'\" That agreement provided that the FAA \"`shall apply to [its] construction, interpretation, and enforcement.'\" Id., at 799. Alafabco defaulted on its obligations under the renewal notes and sought bankruptcy protection in federal court in September 1999.\n\n\n4\nIn return for the dismissal of Alafabco's bankruptcy petition, the bank agreed to renegotiate the outstanding loans in a second debt-restructuring agreement. On December 10, 1999, the parties executed new loan documents encompassing Alafabco's entire outstanding debt, approximately $430,000, which was secured by a mortgage on commercial real estate owned by the individual respondents, by Alafabco's accounts receivable, inventory, supplies, fixtures, machinery, and equipment, and by a mortgage on the house of one of the individual respondents. Id., at 800. As part of the second debt-restructuring agreement, the parties executed an arbitration agreement functionally identical to that of May 3, 1999.\n\n\n5\nWithin a year of the December 1999 debt restructuring, Alafabco brought suit in the Circuit Court of Lawrence County, Alabama, against the bank and its officers. Alafabco alleged, among other causes of action, breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duties, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and interference with a contractual or business relationship. Essentially, the suit alleged that Alafabco detrimentally \"`incur[red] massive debt'\" because the bank had unlawfully reneged on its agreement to provide capital sufficient to complete the Courtland project. Id., at 799. Invoking the arbitration agreements, the bank moved to compel arbitration of the parties' dispute. The Circuit Court ordered respondents to submit to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreements.\n\n\n6\nThe Supreme Court of Alabama reversed over Justice See's dissent. Applying a test it first adopted in Sisters of the Visitation v. Cochran Plastering Co., 775 So. 2d 759 (2000), the court held that the debt-restructuring agreements were the relevant transactions and proceeded to determine whether those transactions, by themselves, had a \"substantial effect on interstate commerce.\" 872 So. 2d, at 801, 803. Because there was no showing \"that any portion of the restructured debt was actually attributable to interstate transactions; that the funds comprising that debt originated out-of-state; or that the restructured debt was inseparable from any out-of-state projects,\" id., at 805, the court found an insufficient nexus with interstate commerce to establish FAA coverage of the parties' dispute.\n\n\n7\nJustice See in dissent explained why, in his view, the court had erred by using the test formulated in Sisters of the Visitation, in which the Supreme Court of Alabama read this Court's opinion in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), to require that \"a particular contract, in order to be enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act must, by itself, have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\" 872 So. 2d, at 808. Rejecting that stringent test and assessing the evidence with a more generous view of the necessary effect on interstate commerce, Justice See would have found that the bank's loans to Alafabco satisfied the FAA's \"involving commerce\" requirement.\n\nII\nThe FAA provides that a\n\n8\n\"written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\" 9 U. S. C. § 2 (emphasis added).\n\n\n9\nThe statute further defines \"commerce\" to include \"commerce among the several States.\" § 1. Echoing Justice See's dissenting opinion, petitioner contends that the decision below gives inadequate breadth to the \"involving commerce\" language of the statute. We agree.\n\n\n10\nWe have interpreted the term \"involving commerce\" in the FAA as the functional equivalent of the more familiar term \"affecting commerce\"—words of art that ordinarily signal the broadest permissible exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause power. Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., 513 U. S., at 273-274. Because the statute provides for \"the enforcement of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the Commerce Clause,\" Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 490 (1987), it is perfectly clear that the FAA encompasses a wider range of transactions than those actually \"in commerce\"—that is, \"within the flow of interstate commerce,\" Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., supra, at 273 (internal quotation marks, citation, and emphasis omitted).\n\n\n11\nThe Supreme Court of Alabama was therefore misguided in its search for evidence that a \"portion of the restructured debt was actually attributable to interstate transactions\" or that the loans \"originated out-of-state\" or that \"the restructured debt was inseparable from any out-of-state projects.\" 872 So. 2d, at 805. Such evidence might be required if the FAA were restricted to transactions actually \"`in commerce,'\" Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U. S. 186, 195-196 (1974), but, as we have explained, that is not the limit of the FAA's reach.\n\n\n12\nNor is application of the FAA defeated because the individual debt-restructuring transactions, taken alone, did not have a \"substantial effect on interstate commerce.\" 872 So. 2d, at 803. Congress' Commerce Clause power \"may be exercised in individual cases without showing any specific effect upon interstate commerce\" if in the aggregate the economic activity in question would represent \"a general practice . . . subject to federal control.\" Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U. S. 219, 236 (1948). See also Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 154 (1971); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127-128 (1942). Only that general practice need bear on interstate commerce in a substantial way. Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196-197, n. 27 (1968); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 37-38 (1937).\n\n\n13\nThis case is well within our previous pronouncements on the extent of Congress' Commerce Clause power. Although the debt-restructuring agreements were executed in Alabama by Alabama residents, they nonetheless satisfy the FAA's \"involving commerce\" test for at least three reasons. First, Alafabco engaged in business throughout the south-eastern United States using substantial loans from the bank that were renegotiated and redocumented in the debt-restructuring agreements. Indeed, the gravamen of Alafabco's state-court suit was that it had incurred \"`massive debt'\" to the bank in order to keep its business afloat, and the bank submitted affidavits of bank officers establishing that its loans to Alafabco had been used in part to finance large construction projects in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama.\n\n\n14\nSecond, the restructured debt was secured by all of Alafabco's business assets, including its inventory of goods assembled from out-of-state parts and raw materials. If the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate local business establishments purchasing substantial quantities of goods that have moved in interstate commerce, Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 304-305 (1964), it necessarily reaches substantial commercial loan transactions secured by such goods.\n\n\n15\nThird, were there any residual doubt about the magnitude of the impact on interstate commerce caused by the particular economic transactions in which the parties were engaged, that doubt would dissipate upon consideration of the \"general practice\" those transactions represent. Mandeville Island Farms, supra, at 236. No elaborate explanation is needed to make evident the broad impact of commercial lending on the national economy or Congress' power to regulate that activity pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27, 38-39 (1980) (\"[B]anking and related financial activities are of profound local concern. . . . Nonetheless, it does not follow that these same activities lack important interstate attributes\"); Perez, supra, at 154-155 (\"Extortionate credit transactions, though purely intrastate, may in the judgment of Congress affect interstate commerce\").\n\n\n16\nThe decision below therefore adheres to an improperly cramped view of Congress' Commerce Clause power. That view, first announced by the Supreme Court of Alabama in Sisters of the Visitation v. Cochran Plastering Co., 775 So. 2d 759 (2000), appears to rest on a misreading of our decision in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995).

PARDUS et al.\nNo. 06-7317.\nSupreme Court of United States.\nDecided June 4, 2007.\nPER CURIAM.\nImprisoned by the State of Colorado and alleging violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment, William Erickson, the petitioner in this Court, filed suit against prison officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. He alleged that a liver condition resulting from hepatitis C required a treatment program that officials had commenced but then wrongfully terminated, *2198 with life-threatening consequences. Deeming these allegations, and others to be noted, to be \"conclusory,\" the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of petitioner's complaint. 198 Fed.Appx. 694, 698 (2006). The holding departs in so stark a manner from the pleading standard mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that we grant review. We vacate the court's judgment and remand the case for further consideration.\nPetitioner was incarcerated in the Limon Correctional Facility in Limon, Colorado, where respondents Barry Pardus and Dr. Anita Bloor were working as prison officials. After Dr. Bloor removed petitioner from the hepatitis C treatment he had been receiving, petitioner sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, complaining, inter alia, that Dr. Bloor had violated his Eighth Amendment rights by demonstrating deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104-105, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976) (\"[D]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment,\" and this includes \"indifference. . . manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed\" (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35-37, 113 S. Ct. 2475, 125 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1993).\nPetitioner based his claim on the following allegations, which we assume to be true for purposes of review here: Officials at Colorado's Department of Corrections (Department) diagnosed petitioner as requiring treatment for hepatitis C. After completing the necessary classes and otherwise complying with the protocols set forth by the Department, petitioner began treatment for the disease. The treatment, which would take a year to complete, involved weekly self-injections of medication by use of a syringe. Soon after petitioner began this treatment, prison officials were unable to account for one of the syringes made available to petitioner (and other prisoners) for medical purposes. Upon searching, they found it in a communal trash can, modified in a manner suggestive of use for injection of illegal drugs. Prisoner Complaint in Civ. Action No. 05-CV-00405-LTB-MJW (D.Colo.), p. 3 (hereinafter Petitioner's Complaint).\nPrison officials, disbelieving petitioner's claim not to have taken the syringe, found that his conduct constituted a violation of the Colorado Code of Penal Discipline for possession of drug paraphernalia. Letter from Anthony A. DeCesaro to William Erickson (Sept. 30, 2004), attached to Petitioner's Complaint. This conduct, according to the officials, led to the \"reasonable inference\" that petitioner had intended to use drugs, so the officials removed petitioner from his hepatitis C treatment. Ibid. \"The successful treatment of Hepatitis C is incumbent upon the individual remaining drug and alcohol free to give the liver a better chance of recovery,\" they indicated, ibid., an explanation they later offered to defend against petitioner's allegations of cruel and unusual punishment, see Defendants' Motion to Dismiss in Civ. Action No. 05-CV-00405-LTB-MJW, p. 10. Assuming that a person in the course of this treatment takes illicit drugs, the prison's protocol mandates a waiting period of one year followed by a mandatory drug education class lasting six months. Brief in Opposition 4. Petitioner therefore could face a delay of some 18 months before he would be able to restart treatment.\n*2199 In his complaint petitioner alleged Dr. Bloor had \"removed [him] from [his] hepatitis C treatment\" in violation of department protocol, \"thus endangering [his] life.\" Petitioner's Complaint 2. Petitioner attached to the complaint certain grievance forms. In these he claimed, among other things, he was suffering from \"continued damage to [his] liver\" as a result of the nontreatment. Colorado Dept. of Corrections Offender Grievance Form (June 30, 2004). The complaint requested relief including damages and an injunction requiring that the Department treat petitioner for hepatitis C \"under the standards of the treatment [protocol] established by [the Department].\" Petitioner's Complaint 8.\nThree months after filing his complaint, and well before the District Court entered a judgment against him, petitioner filed a Motion for Expedited Review Due to Imminent Danger, in Civ. Action No. 05-B-405 (MJW) (D.Colo.). Indicating it was \"undisputed\" that he had hepatitis C, that he met the Department's standards for treatment of the disease, and that \"furtherance of this disease can cause irreversible damage to [his] liver and possible death,\" petitioner alleged that \"numerous inmates\" in his prison community had died of the disease and that he was \"in imminent danger\" himself \"due to [the Department's] refusal to treat him.\" Ibid. He had identified similar allegations in an earlier filing, explaining that \"his liver is suffering irreversible damage\" due to the decision to remove him from treatment and that he \"will suffer irreparable damage if his disease goes untreated.\" Plaintiff's Objections to the Magistrate's Recommendations in Civ. Action No. 05-CV-00405-LTB-MJW, p. 3.\nRespondents answered these filings with a motion to dismiss. The Magistrate Judge recommended, as relevant, that the District Court dismiss the complaint on the ground it failed to allege Dr. Bloor's actions had caused petitioner \"substantial harm.\" Recommendation on Defendants' Motion To Dismiss, p. 12. The District Court issued a short order indicating its agreement with the Magistrate Judge and dismissing the complaint.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed. It quoted extensively from the Magistrate Judge's discussion of \"substantial harm\" before holding that petitioner had made \"only conclusory allegations to the effect that he has suffered a cognizable independent harm as a result of his removal from the [hepatitis C] treatment program.\" 198 Fed.Appx., at 698. Acknowledging decisions by courts that have found Eighth Amendment violations when delays in medical treatment have involved \"life-threatening situations and instances in which it is apparent that delay would exacerbate the prisoner's medical problems\" (and that have, moreover, indicated the Eighth Amendment \"protects against future harm to an inmate\"), id., at 697 (internal quotation marks omitted), the court nevertheless found petitioner's complaint deficient: Petitioner had, according to the court, failed to \"allege that as a result of the discontinuance of the treatment itself shortly after it began or the interruption of treatment for approximately eighteen months he suffered any harm, let alone substantial harm, [other] than what he already faced from the Hepatitis C itself,\" id., at 698 (internal quotation marks omitted). Having reached this conclusion, the court saw no need to address whether the complaint alleged facts sufficient to support a finding that Dr. Bloor had made her decisions with a \"sufficiently culpable state of mind.\" Id., at 697, 698 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIt may in the final analysis be shown that the District Court was correct to grant respondents' motion to dismiss. *2200 That is not the issue here, however. It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the allegations in question, concerning harm caused petitioner by the termination of his medication, were too conclusory to establish for pleading purposes that petitioner had suffered \"a cognizable independent harm\" as a result of his removal from the hepatitis C treatment program. Id., at 698.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Specific facts are not necessary; the statement need only \"`give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.'\" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957)). In addition, when ruling on a defendant's motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint. Bell Atlantic Corp., supra, at ___, 127 S. Ct. 1955 (slip op., at 8-9) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 508, n. 1, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002); Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S. Ct. 1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989); Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1974)).\nThe complaint stated that Dr. Bloor's decision to remove petitioner from his prescribed hepatitis C medication was \"endangering [his] life.\" Petitioner's Complaint 2. It alleged this medication was withheld \"shortly after\" petitioner had commenced a treatment program that would take one year, that he was \"still in need of treatment for this disease,\" and that the prison officials were in the meantime refusing to provide treatment. Id., at 3, 4. This alone was enough to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2). Petitioner, in addition, bolstered his claim by making more specific allegations in documents attached to the complaint and in later filings.\nThe Court of Appeals' departure from the liberal pleading standards set forth by Rule 8(a)(2) is even more pronounced in this particular case because petitioner has been proceeding, from the litigation's outset, without counsel. A document filed pro se is \"to be liberally construed,\" Estelle, 429 U.S., at 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, and \"a pro se complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,\" ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(f) (\"All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice\").\nWhether petitioner's complaint is sufficient in all respects is a matter yet to be determined, for respondents raised multiple arguments in their motion to dismiss. In particular, the proper application of the controlling legal principles to the facts is yet to be determined. The case cannot, however, be dismissed on the ground that petitioner's allegations of harm were too conclusory to put these matters in issue. Certiorari and leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nJustice SCALIA would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.\nJustice THOMAS, dissenting.\nI have repeatedly stated that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment historically concerned only injuries relating to a criminal sentence. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 861, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994) *2201 (opinion concurring in judgment); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 42, 113 S. Ct. 2475, 125 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1993) (dissenting opinion); Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 18-20, 112 S. Ct. 995, 117 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1992) (dissenting opinion). But even applying the Court's flawed Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, \"I would draw the line at actual, serious injuries and reject the claim that exposure to the risk of injury can violate the Eighth Amendment.\" Helling, supra, at 42, 113 S. Ct. 2475 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Consistent with these views, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n[June 22, 1999]\nJustice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nRespondent United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), dismissed petitioner Vaughn L. Murphy from his job as a UPS mechanic because of his high blood pressure. Petitioner filed suit under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act), 104 Stat. 328, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., in Federal District Court. The District Court granted summary judgment to respondent, and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. We must decide whether the Court of Appeals correctly considered petitioner in his medicated state when it held that petitioner's impairment does not \"substantially limi[t]\" one or more of his major life activities and whether it correctly determined that petitioner is not \"regarded as disabled.\" See §12102(2). In light of our decision in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., ante, p. ____, we conclude that the Court of Appeals' resolution of both issues was correct.\n\n\n2\n* Petitioner was first diagnosed with hypertension (high blood pressure) when he was 10 years old.  Unmedicated, his blood pressure is approximately 250/160. With medication, however, petitioner's \"hypertension does not significantly restrict his activities and . . . in general he can function normally and can engage in activities that other persons normally do.\" 946 F. Supp. 872, 875 (Kan. 1996) (discussing testimony of petitioner's physician).\n\n\n3\nIn August 1994, respondent hired petitioner as a mechanic, a position that required petitioner to drive commercial motor vehicles. Petitioner does not challenge the District Court's conclusion that driving a commercial motor vehicle is an essential function of the mechanic's job at UPS. 946 F. Supp., at 882-883. To drive such vehicles, however, petitioner had to satisfy certain health requirements imposed by the Department of Transportation (DOT). 49 CFR § 391.41(a) (1998) (\"A person shall not drive a commercial motor vehicle unless he/she is physically qualified to do so and . . . has on his/her person . . . a medical examiner's certificate that he/she is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle\"). One such requirement is that the driver of a commercial motor vehicle in interstate commerce have \"no current clinical diagnosis of high blood pressure likely to interfere with his/her ability to operate a commercial vehicle safely.\" §391.41(b)(6).\n\n\n4\nAt the time respondent hired him, petitioner's blood pressure was so high, measuring at 186/124, that he was not qualified for DOT health certification, see App. 98a-102a (Department of Transportation, Medical Regulatory Criteria for Evaluation Under Section 391.41(b)(6), attached as exhibit to Affidavit and Testimony of John R. McMahon) (hereinafter Medical Regulatory Criteria). Nonetheless, petitioner was erroneously granted certification, and he commenced work. In September 1994, a UPS Medical Supervisor who was reviewing petitioner's medical files discovered the error and requested that petitioner have his blood pressure retested. Upon retesting, petitioner's blood pressure was measured at 160/102 and 164/104.  See App. 48a (testimony of Vaughn Murphy). On October 5, 1994, respondent fired petitioner on the belief that his blood pressure exceeded the DOT's requirements for drivers of commercial motor vehicles.\n\n\n5\nPetitioner brought suit under Title I of the ADA in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment. It held that, to determine whether petitioner is disabled under the ADA, his \"impairment should be evaluated in its medicated state.\" 946 F. Supp., at 881. Noting that when petitioner is medicated he is inhibited only in lifting heavy objects but otherwise functions normally, the court held that petitioner is not \"disabled\" under the ADA. Id., at 881-882. The court also rejected petitioner's claim that he was \"regarded as\" disabled, holding that respondent \"did not regard Murphy as disabled, only that he was not certifiable under DOT regulations.\" Id., at 882.\n\n\n6\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment. 141 F.3d 1185 (CA10 1999) (judgt. order). Citing its decision in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 130 F.3d 893, 902 (CA10 1997), aff'd, ___ U.S. ___ (1999), that an individual claiming a disability under the ADA should be assessed with regard to any mitigating or corrective measures employed, the court held that petitioner's hypertension is not a disability because his doctor had testified that when petitioner is medicated, he \" 'functions normally doing everyday activity that an everyday person does.' \" App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The court also affirmed the District Court's determination that petitioner is not \"regarded as\" disabled under the ADA. It explained that respondent did not terminate petitioner \"on an unsubstantiated fear that he would suffer a heart attack or stroke,\" but \"because his blood pressure exceeded the DOT's requirements for drivers of commercial vehicles.\" Id., at 5a. We granted certiorari, 525 U.S.____ (1999), and we now affirm.\n\nII\n\n7\nThe first question presented in this case is whether the determination of petitioner's disability is made with reference to the mitigating measures he employs. We have answered that question in Sutton in the affirmative. Given that holding, the result in this case is clear. The Court of Appeals concluded that, when medicated, petitioner's high blood pressure does not substantially limit him in any major life activity. Petitioner did not seek, and we did not grant, certiorari on whether this conclusion was correct. Because the question whether petitioner is disabled when taking medication is not before us, we have no occasion here to consider whether petitioner is \"disabled\" due to limitations that persist despite his medication or the negative side effects of his medication. Instead, the question granted was limited to whether, under the ADA, the determination of whether an individual's impairment \"substantially limits\" one or more major life activities should be made without consideration of mitigating measures.  Consequently, we conclude that the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the grant of summary judgment in respondent's favor on the claim that petitioner is substantially limited in one or more major life activities and thus disabled under the ADA.\n\nIII\n\n8\nThe second issue presented is also largely resolved by our opinion in Sutton. Petitioner argues that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that he is not \"regarded as\" disabled because of his high blood pressure. As we held in Sutton, ante, p. 15, a person is \"regarded as\" disabled within the meaning of the ADA if a covered entity mistakenly believes that the person's actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. Here, petitioner alleges that his hypertension is regarded as substantially limiting him in the major life activity of working, when in fact it does not. To support this claim, he points to testimony from respondent's resource manager that respondent fired petitioner due to his hypertension, which he claims evidences respondent's belief that petitioner's hypertension-and consequent inability to obtain DOT certification-substantially limits his ability to work. In response, respondent argues that it does not regard petitioner as substantially limited in the major life activity of working but, rather, regards him as unqualified to work as a UPS mechanic because he is unable to obtain DOT health certification.\n\n\n9\nAs a preliminary matter, we note that there remains some dispute as to whether petitioner meets the requirements for DOT certification. As discussed above, petitioner was incorrectly granted DOT certification at his first examination when he should have instead been found unqualified. See supra, at 2. Upon retesting, although petitioner's blood pressure was not low enough to qualify him for the one-year certification that he had incorrectly been issued, it was sufficient to qualify him for optional temporary DOT health certification. App. 98a-102a (Medical Regulatory Criteria). Had a physician examined petitioner and, in light of his medical history, declined to issue a temporary DOT certification, we would not second-guess that decision. Here, however, it appears that UPS determined that petitioner could not meet the DOT standards and did not allow him to attempt to obtain the optional temporary certification. Id., at 84a-86a (testimony of Monica Sloan, UPS's company nurse); id., at 54a-55a (testimony and affidavit of Vaughn Murphy). We need not resolve the question of whether petitioner could meet the standards for DOT health certification, however, as it goes only to whether petitioner is qualified and whether respondent has a defense based on the DOT regulations, see Albertsons v. Kirkingburg, post, p. ____-issues not addressed by the court below or raised in the petition for certiorari.\n\n\n10\nThe only issue remaining is whether the evidence that petitioner is regarded as unable to obtain DOT certification (regardless of whether he can, in fact, obtain optional temporary certification) is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether petitioner is regarded as substantially limited in one or more major life activities. As in Sutton, ante, at 18-19, we assume, arguendo, that the EEOC regulations regarding the disability determination are valid. When referring to the major life activity of working, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines \"substantially limits\" as: \"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\" 29 CFR §1630(j)(3)(i) (1998). The EEOC further identifies several factors that courts should consider when determining whether an individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of working, including \"the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within [the] geographical area [reasonably accessible to the individual], from which the individual is also disqualified.\" §1630(j)(3)(ii)(B). Thus, to be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, one must be regarded as precluded from more than a particular job. See §1630(j)(3)(i) (\"The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working\").\n\n\n11\nAgain, assuming without deciding that these regulations are valid, petitioner has failed to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is regarded as disabled. Petitioner was fired from the position of UPS mechanic because he has a physical impairment-hypertension-that is regarded as preventing him from obtaining DOT health certification. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a (UPS terminated Murphy because \"his blood pressure exceeded the DOT's requirements for drivers of commercial vehicles\"); 946 F. Supp., at 882 (\"[T]he court concludes UPS did not regard Murphy as disabled, only that he was not certifiable under DOT regulations\"); App. 125a, ¶18 (Defendant's Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment) (\"UPS considers driving commercial motor vehicles an essential function of plaintiff 's job as mechanic\"); App. 103a (testimony of John R. McMahon) (stating that the reason why petitioner was fired was that he \"did not meet the requirements of the Department of Transportation\").\n\n\n12\nThe evidence that petitioner is regarded as unable to meet the DOT regulations is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether petitioner is regarded as unable to perform a class of jobs utilizing his skills. At most, petitioner has shown that he is regarded as unable to perform the job of mechanic only when that job requires driving a commercial motor vehicle-a specific type of vehicle used on a highway in interstate commerce. 49 CFR § 390.5 (defining \"commercial motor vehicle\" as a vehicle weighing over 10,000 pounds, designed to carry 16 or more passengers, or used in the transportation of hazardous materials). Petitioner has put forward no evidence that he is regarded as unable to perform any mechanic job that does not call for driving a commercial motor vehicle and thus does not require DOT certification. Indeed, it is undisputed that petitioner is generally employable as a mechanic. Petitioner has \"performed mechanic jobs that did not require DOT certification\" for \"over 22 years,\" and he secured another job as a mechanic shortly after leaving UPS. 946 F. Supp., at 875, 876. Moreover, respondent presented uncontroverted evidence that petitioner could perform jobs such as diesel mechanic, automotive mechanic, gas-engine repairer, and gas-welding equipment mechanic, all of which utilize petitioner's mechanical skills. See App. 115a (report of Lewis Vierling).\n\n\n13\nConsequently, in light of petitioner's skills and the array of jobs available to petitioner utilizing those skills, petitioner has failed to show that he is regarded as unable to perform a class of jobs. Rather, the undisputed record evidence demonstrates that petitioner is, at most, regarded as unable to perform only a particular job. This is insufficient, as a matter of law, to prove that petitioner is regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working. See Sutton, ante, at 19-20.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals correctly granted summary judgment in favor of respondent on petitioner's claim that he is regarded as disabled. For the reasons stated, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n\n\n14\nIt is so ordered.\n\nDISSENTING OPINION\n\n15\nJustice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins, dissenting.\n\n\n16\nFor the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., ante, p. ___, I respectfully dissent. I believe that petitioner has a \"disability\" within the meaning of the ADA because, assuming petitioner's uncontested evidence to be true, his very severe hypertension-in its unmedicated state-\"substantially limits\" his ability to perform several major life activities. Without medication, petitioner would likely be hospitalized. See App. 81. Indeed, unlike Sutton, this case scarcely requires us to speculate whether Congress intended the Act to cover individuals with this impairment. Severe hypertension, in my view, easily falls within the ADA's nucleus of covered impairments. See Sutton, ante, at 3-9 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\n\n17\nBecause the Court of Appeals did not address whether petitioner was qualified or whether he could perform the essential job functions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, I would reverse and remand for further proceedings.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

See Fla.Stat. §§212.08(7)(w), 212.05(1)(i) (Supp.1988).  In 1990, the Florida Supreme Court found this classification invalid under the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  See Department of Revenue v. Magazine Publishers of America, Inc., 565 So.2d 1304 (1990), vacated and remanded, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Dept. of Revenue, 499 U.S. 972, 111 S.Ct. 1614, 113 L.Ed.2d 712 (1991), reaff'd, 604 So.2d 459 (1992).  In the wake of this ruling, Newsweek, a magazine, filed a claim for a refund of sales taxes it had paid between 1988 and 1990.  See Fla.Stat. §215.26(1) (Supp.1998) (\"The Comptroller of the state may refund  . . .  any moneys paid into the State Treasury'').\n\n\n2\nWhen the Department of Revenue denied the refund, Newsweek filed suit, alleging the State's failure to accord it retroactive relief violated its due process rights under McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U.S. 18, 110 S.Ct. 2238, 110 L.Ed.2d 17 (1990).  The Florida trial court granted summary judgment against Newsweek, and the District Court of Appeal affirmed.  Although acknowledging McKesson 's requirement of \"meaningful backward-looking relief'' when a taxpayer is forced to pay a tax before having an opportunity to establish its unconstitutionality, the District Court of Appeal held: \"McKesson is distinguishable because that holding was expressly predicated upon the fact that the taxpayer had no meaningful predeprivation remedy.'' 689 So.2d 361, 363 (1997).  The court interpreted Florida law to permit prepayment tax challenges by filing an action and paying the contested amount into the court registry, posting a bond, or obtaining a court order approving an alternative arrangement.  See id., at 363-364 (citing Fla.Stat. §72.011 (1987)).  The court concluded Newsweek was afforded due process because it could have pursued this prepayment remedy without suffering onerous penalties.  See 689 So.2d, at 364.\n\n\n3\nThe District Court of Appeal's decision failed to consider our decision in Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S. 106, 115 S.Ct. 547, 130 L.Ed.2d 454 (1994).  There, the Georgia Supreme Court had rejected a taxpayer's refund claim filed pursuant to a general refund statute, dismissing any due process concerns because a predeprivation remedy was available.  See id., at 110, 115 S.Ct., at 549-550.  While assuming the constitutional adequacy of Georgia's predeprivation procedures, we nonetheless reversed because \"no reasonable taxpayer would have thought that [the predeprivation procedures] represented, in light of the apparent applicability of the refund statute, the exclusive remedy for unlawful taxes.'' Id., at 111, 115 S.Ct., at 550 (emphasis deleted).  Until the Georgia Supreme Court's ruling, the taxpayer had no way of knowing from either the statutory language or case law that he could not pursue a postpayment refund and was relegated to a predeprivation remedy.  See id., at 111-112, 115 S.Ct., at 550-551.  We emphasized a State \"has the flexibility to maintain an exclusively predeprivation remedial scheme, so long as that scheme is \"clear and certain.''' Id., at 110-111, 115 S.Ct., at 550.  But a State may not \"bait and switch'' by \"hold[ing] out what plainly appears to be a \"clear and certain' postdeprivation remedy and then declare, only after the disputed  taxes have been paid, that no such remedy exists.'' Id., at 108,  111, 115 S.Ct., at 549, 550.\n\n\n4\nUnder Florida law, there was a long standing practice of permitting taxpayers to seek refunds under §215.26 for taxes paid under an unconstitutional statute.  See, e.g., State ex rel. Hardaway Contracting Co. v. Lee, 155 Fla. 724, 21 So.2d 211 (1945).  At Florida's urging, federal courts have dismissed taxpayer challenges, including constitutional challenges, because §215.26 appeared to provide an adequate postpayment remedy for refunds.  See Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. §1341 (\"The district courts shall not enjoin  . . .  any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State''); see, e.g., Osceola v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 893 F.2d 1231, 1233 (C.A.11 1990); Rendon v. State of Fla., 930 F.Supp. 601 (S.D.Fla.1996).  This Court, too, has interpreted Florida law to provide a postpayment remedy.  See McKesson, supra, at 24, n. 4, 110 S.Ct., at 2243, n. 4 (\"It appears  . . .  Florida law does not require a taxpayer to pay under protest in order to preserve the right to challenge a remittance in a postpayment refund action'').  The State does not dispute this settled understanding.  The effect of the District Court of Appeal's decision below, however, was to cut off Newsweek's recourse to §215.26.  While Florida may be free to require taxpayers to litigate first and pay later, due process prevents it from applying this requirement to taxpayers, like Newsweek, who reasonably relied on the apparent availability of a postpayment refund when paying the tax.\n\n\n5\nNewsweek is entitled to a clear and certain remedy and thus it can use the refund procedures to adjudicate the merits of its claim.  We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment, and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n6\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

BUSH, PETITIONERv.PALM BEACH COUNTY CANVASSING BOARD et al.\nNo. 00-836\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nDecember 4, 2000\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT\nPer Curiam.\n\n\n1\nThe Supreme Court of the State of Florida interpreted its elections statutes in proceedings brought to require manual recounts of ballots, and the certification of the recount results, for votes cast in the quadrennial Presidential election held on November 7, 2000. Governor George W. Bush, Republican candidate for the Presidency, filed a petition for certiorari to review the Florida Supreme Court decision. We granted certiorari on two of the questions presented by petitioner: whether the decision of the Florida Supreme Court, by effectively changing the State's elector appointment procedures after election day, violated the Due Process Clause or 3 U.S.C. § 5 and whether the decision of that court changed the manner in which the State's electors are to be selected, in violation of the legislature's power to designate the manner for selection under Art. II, §1, cl. 2 of the United States Constitution. 531 U.S. ____ (2000).\n\n\n2\nOn November 8, 2000, the day following the Presidential election, the Florida Division of Elections reported that Governor Bush had received 2,909,135 votes, and respondent Democrat Vice President Albert Gore, Jr., had received 2,907,351, a margin of 1,784 in Governor Bush's favor. Under Fla. Stat. §102.141(4) (2000), because the margin of victory was equal to or less than one-half of one percent of the votes cast, an automatic machine recount occurred. The recount resulted in a much smaller margin of victory for Governor Bush. Vice President Gore then exercised his statutory right to submit written requests for manual recounts to the canvassing board of any county. See §102.166. He requested recounts in four counties: Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade.\n\n\n3\nThe parties urged conflicting interpretations of the Florida Election Code respecting the authority of the canvassing boards, the Secretary of State (hereinafter Secretary), and the Elections Canvassing Commission. On November 14, in an action brought by Volusia County, and joined by the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, Vice President Gore, and the Florida Democratic Party, the Florida Circuit Court ruled that the statutory 7-day deadline was mandatory, but that the Volusia board could amend its returns at a later date. The court further ruled that the Secretary, after \"considering all attendant facts and circumstances,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, could exercise her discretion in deciding whether to include the late amended returns in the statewide certification.\n\n\n4\nThe Secretary responded by issuing a set of criteria by which she would decide whether to allow a late filing. The Secretary ordered that, by 2 p.m. the following day, November 15, any county desiring to forward late returns submit a written statement of the facts and circumstances justifying a later filing. Four counties submitted statements and, after reviewing the submissions, the Secretary determined that none justified an extension of the filing deadline. On November 16, the Florida Democratic Party and Vice President Gore filed an emergency motion in the state court, arguing that the Secretary had acted arbitrarily and in contempt of the court's earlier ruling. The following day, the court denied the motion, ruling that the Secretary had not acted arbitrarily and had exercised her discretion in a reasonable manner consistent with the court's earlier ruling. The Democratic Party and Vice President Gore appealed to the First District Court of Appeal, which certified the matter to the Florida Supreme Court. That court accepted jurisdiction and sua sponte entered an order enjoining the Secretary and the Elections Canvassing Commission from finally certifying the results of the election and declaring a winner until further order of that court.\n\n\n5\nThe Supreme Court, with the expedition requisite for the controversy, issued its decision on November 21. Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd. v. Harris, Nos. SC00_2346, SC00_2348, and SC00_2349 (Nov. 21, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a. As the court saw the matter, there were two principal questions: whether a discrepancy between an original machine return and a sample manual recount resulting from the way a ballot has been marked or punched is an \"error in vote tabulation\" justifying a full manual recount; and how to reconcile what it spoke of as two conflicts in Florida's election laws: (a) between the time frame for conducting a manual recount under Fla. Stat. §102.166 (2000) and the time frame for submitting county returns under §§102.111 and 102.112, and (b) between §102.111, which provides that the Secretary \"shall _ ignor[e]\" late election returns, and §102.112, which provides that she \"may _ ignor[e]\" such returns.\n\n\n6\nWith regard to the first issue, the court held that, under the plain text of the statute, a discrepancy between a sample manual recount and machine returns due to the way in which a ballot was punched or marked did constitute an \"error in vote tabulation\" sufficient to trigger the statutory provisions for a full manual recount.\n\n\n7\nWith regard to the second issue, the court held that the \"shall _ ignor[e]\" provision of §102.111 conflicts with the \"may . . . ignor[e]\" provision of §102.112, and that the \"may _ ignor[e]\" provision controlled. The court turned to the questions whether and when the Secretary may ignore late manual recounts. The court relied in part upon the right to vote set forth in the Declaration of Rights of the Florida Constitution in concluding that late manual recounts could be rejected only under limited circumstances. The court then stated: \"[B]ecause of our reluctance to rewrite the Florida Election Code, we conclude that we must invoke the equitable powers of this Court to fashion a remedy _ .\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a. The court thus imposed a deadline of November 26, at 5 p.m., for a return of ballot counts. The 7-day deadline of §102.111, assuming it would have applied, was effectively extended by 12 days. The court further directed the Secretary to accept manual counts submitted prior to that deadline.\n\n\n8\nAs a general rule, this Court defers to a state court's interpretation of a state statute. But in the case of a law enacted by a state legislature applicable not only to elections to state offices, but also to the selection of Presidential electors, the legislature is not acting solely under the authority given it by the people of the State, but by virtue of a direct grant of authority made under Art. II, §1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution. That provision reads:\n\n\n9\n\"Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress _ .\"\n\n\n10\nAlthough we did not address the same question petitioner raises here, in McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 25 (1892), we said:\n\n\n11\n\"[Art. II, §1, cl. 2] does not read that the people or the citizens shall appoint, but that `each State shall'; and if the words `in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct,' had been omitted, it would seem that the legislative power of appointment could not have been successfully questioned in the absence of any provision in the state constitution in that regard. Hence the insertion of those words, while operating as a limitation upon the State in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power, cannot be held to operate as a limitation on that power itself.\"\n\n\n12\nThere are expressions in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida that may be read to indicate that it construed the Florida Election Code without regard to the extent to which the Florida Constitution could, consistent with Art. II, §1, cl. 2, \"circumscribe the legislative power.\" The opinion states, for example, that \"[t]o the extent that the Legislature may enact laws regulating the electoral process, those laws are valid only if they impose no `unreasonable or unnecessary' restraints on the right of suffrage\" guaranteed by the state constitution. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a. The opinion also states that \"[b]ecause election laws are intended to facilitate the right of suffrage, such laws must be liberally construed in favor of the citizens' right to vote _ .\" Ibid.\n\n\n13\nIn addition, 3 U.S.C. § 5 provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n14\n\"If any State shall have provided, by laws enacted prior to the day fixed for the appointment of the electors, for its final determination of any controversy or contest concerning the appointment of all or any of the electors of such State, by judicial or other methods or procedures, and such determination shall have been made at least six days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, such determination made pursuant to such law so existing on said day, and made at least six days prior to said time of meeting of the electors, shall be conclusive, and shall govern in the counting of the electoral votes as provided in the Constitution, and as hereinafter regulated, so far as the ascertainment of the electors appointed by such State is concerned.\"\n\n\n15\nThe parties before us agree that whatever else may be the effect of this section, it creates a \"safe harbor\" for a State insofar as congressional consideration of its electoral votes is concerned. If the state legislature has provided for final determination of contests or controversies by a law made prior to election day, that determination shall be conclusive if made at least six days prior to said time of meeting of the electors. The Florida Supreme Court cited 3 U.S.C. § 1_10 in a footnote of its opinion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a, n. 55, but did not discuss §5. Since §5 contains a principle of federal law that would assure finality of the State's determination if made pursuant to a state law in effect before the election, a legislative wish to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" would counsel against any construction of the Election Code that Congress might deem to be a change in the law.\n\n\n16\nAfter reviewing the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court, we find \"that there is considerable uncertainty as to the precise grounds for the decision.\" Minnesota v. National Tea Co., 309 U.S. 551, 555 (1940). This is sufficient reason for us to decline at this time to review the federal questions asserted to be present. See ibid.\n\n\n17\n\"It is fundamental that state courts be left free and unfettered by us in interpreting their state constitutions. But it is equally important that ambiguous or obscure adjudications by state courts do not stand as barriers to a determination by this Court of the validity under the federal constitution of state action. Intelligent exercise of our appellate powers compels us to ask for the elimination of the obscurities and ambiguities from the opinions in such cases.\" Id., at 557.\n\n\n18\nSpecifically, we are unclear as to the extent to which the Florida Supreme Court saw the Florida Constitution as circumscribing the legislature's authority under Art. II, §1, cl. 2. We are also unclear as to the consideration the Florida Supreme Court accorded to 3 U.S.C. § 5. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\nIt is so ordered\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

With him on the briefs were Richard E. Coleson and M. Miller Baker.\nSolicitor General Clement argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief were Deputy Solicitor General Garre, Malcolm L. Stewart, Lawrence H. Norton, Richard B. Bader, David Kolker, and Harry J. Summers.[*]\n*411 PER CURIAM.\nThe Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), § 203, as amended, 116 Stat. 91, prohibits corporations from using their general treasury funds to pay for any \"electioneering communications.\" 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. III). BCRA § 201 defines \"electioneering communications\" as any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a candidate for federal office and that is broadcast within 30 days of a federal primary election or 60 days of a federal general election in the jurisdiction in which that candidate is running for office. 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. III). Appellant Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), brought this action against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), seeking a judgment declaring BCRA unconstitutional as applied to several broadcast advertisements that it intended to run during the 2004 election. WRTL also sought a preliminary injunction barring the FEC from enforcing BCRA against those advertisements. WRTL does not dispute that its advertisements are covered by BCRA's definition of prohibited electioneering communications. Instead, it contends that BCRA cannot be constitutionally applied to its particular communications because they constitute \"grassroots lobbying advertisements.\" Brief for Appellee 35 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the FEC has statutory authority to exempt by regulation certain communications from BCRA's prohibition on electioneering communications, § 434(f)(3)(B)(iv), at this point, it has not done so for the types of advertisements at issue here.\nThe three-judge District Court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and subsequently dismissed WRTL's *412 complaint in an unpublished opinion. We noted probable jurisdiction, 545 U.S. 1164 (2005). Appellant asks us to reverse the judgment of the District Court because that court incorrectly read a footnote in our opinion in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U.S. 93 (2003), as foreclosing any \"as-applied\" challenges to the prohibition on electioneering communications. We agree with WRTL that the District Court misinterpreted the relevance of our \"uphold[ing] all applications of the primary definition\" of electioneering communications. Id., at 190, n. 73. Contrary to the understanding of the District Court, that footnote merely notes that because we found BCRA's primary definition of \"electioneering communication\" facially valid when used with regard to BCRA's disclosure and funding requirements, it was unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of the backup definition Congress provided. Ibid. In upholding § 203 against a facial challenge, we did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges.\nThe FEC argues that the District Court also rested its decision on the alternative ground that the facts of this case \"suggest that WRTL's advertisements may fit the very type of activity McConnell found Congress had a compelling interest in regulating.\" No. 04-1260 (DC, Aug. 17, 2004), App. to Juris. Statement 8a. It is not clear to us, however, that the District Court intended its opinion to rest on this ground. For one thing, the court used the word \"may.\" For another, its separate opinion dismissing WRTL's challenge with prejudice characterized its previous opinion as holding that \"WRTL's `as-applied' challenge to BCRA is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in McConnell.\" Id., at 3a. Given this ambiguity, we cannot say with certainty that the District Court's dismissal was based on this alternative ground.\nWe therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case for the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL's as-applied challenge in the first instance.\nIt is so ordered.\nNOTES\n[*]  Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the American Civil Liberties Union by Steven R.

S. C. § 2254(b)(1), giving the State the \"`opportunity to . . . correct' alleged violations of its prisoners' federal rights,\" Duncan v. Henry, 513 U. S. 364, 365, which means he must \"fairly present\" his claim in each appropriate state court to alert that court to the claim's federal nature. After respondent Reese appealed his state convictions and sentences and the lower state courts denied him collateral relief, the Oregon Supreme Court denied him discretionary review. His subsequent federal habeas petition raised, inter alia, a federal constitutional ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim. The Federal District Court held that Reese had not \"fairly presented\" this claim to the state courts because his state appeals court brief had not indicated that he was complaining about a federal law violation. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding the \"fair presentation\" requirement satisfied because the State Supreme Court justices had had the opportunity to read the lower court decision before deciding whether to grant discretionary review. And, had they read that opinion, they would have, or should have, realized that his claim rested upon federal law.\nHeld: A state prisoner ordinarily does not \"fairly present\" a federal claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition, a brief, or similar papers to find material that will alert it to the presence of such a claim. Pp. 30-34.\n(a) Assuming that Reese's petition by itself did not properly alert the State Supreme Court to the federal nature of his claim, Reese failed to meet the \"fair presentation\" standard. To say that a petitioner \"fairly presents\" a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading the lower court opinions is to say that those judges must read those opinions — for otherwise they would forfeit the State's opportunity to decide the claim in the first instance. Federal habeas law does not impose such a requirement. That requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices, since they do not necessarily read lower court opinions in every case. And it would impose a serious burden upon those judges with discretionary review powers, whose heavy workloads would be significantly increased if they had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance. Finally, the requirement is unnecessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek federal habeas. A litigant can easily indicate his claim's federal law basis in a petition or brief, for example, by citing to the federal source of law on which he relies or simply labeling the claim \"federal.\" Pp. 30-32.\n(b) This Court is not wrong to assume that Reese's petition by itself failed to alert the State Supreme Court to his claim's federal nature. He must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" refers to a federal claim, cite any case that might have alerted the court to his claim's alleged federal nature, or even contain a factual description supporting his claim. Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless \"fairly presents\" a federal \"ineffective assistance\" claim because (1) \"ineffective\" is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal law claims, and (2) the state-law standards for adjudicating state and federal \"inadequate/ineffective appellate assistance\" claims are identical. This Court rejects his first argument because he has not demonstrated that state law uses \"ineffective assistance\" as referring only to a federal-law, rather than a similar state-law, claim. However, Reese's second argument was not addressed by, or presented to, the Ninth Circuit, and first appeared here in Reese's merits brief. Because the issue is complex and lower court consideration would help in its resolution, the Court, without expressing any view on the issue's merits, exercises its Rule 15.2 discretion and deems the argument waived. Pp. 32-34.\n282 F. 3d 1184, reversed.\nBREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and O'CONNOR, SCALIA, KENNEDY, SOUTER, THOMAS, and GINSBURG, JJ., joined. STEVENS, J., filed a dissenting opinion, post, p. 34.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\nHardy Myers, Attorney General of Oregon, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Peter Shepherd, Deputy Attorney General, Mary H. Williams, Solicitor General, and Janet A. Klapstein and Robert B. Rocklin, Assistant Attorneys General.\nDennis N. Balske, by appointment of the Court, 540 U. S. 806, argued the cause for respondent.*\nJUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nBefore seeking a federal writ of habeas corpus, a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies, 28 U. S. C. § 2254(b)(1), thereby giving the State the \"`\"opportunity to pass upon and correct\" alleged violations of its prisoners' federal rights.'\" Duncan v. Henry, 513 U. S. 364, 365 (1995) (per curiam) (quoting Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270, 275 (1971)). To provide the State with the necessary \"opportunity,\" the prisoner must \"fairly present\" his claim in each appropriate state court (including a state supreme court with powers of discretionary review), thereby alerting that court to the federal nature of the claim. Duncan, supra, at 365-366; O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 845 (1999). This case focuses upon the requirement of \"fair presentation.\"\n\n\n2\n* Michael Reese, the respondent, appealed his state-court kidnaping and attempted sodomy convictions and sentences through Oregon's state court system. He then brought collateral relief proceedings in the state courts (where he was represented by appointed counsel). After the lower courts denied him collateral relief, Reese filed a petition for discretionary review in the Oregon Supreme Court.\n\n\n3\nThe petition made several different legal claims. In relevant part, the petition asserted that Reese had received \"ineffective assistance of both trial court and appellate court counsel.\" App. 47. The petition added that \"his imprisonment is in violation of [Oregon state law].\" Id., at 48. It said that his trial counsel's conduct violated several provisions of the Federal Constitution. Ibid. But it did not say that his separate appellate \"ineffective assistance\" claim violated federal law. The Oregon Supreme Court denied review.\n\n\n4\nReese ultimately sought a federal writ of habeas corpus, raising, among other claims, a federal constitutional claim that his appellate counsel did not effectively represent him during one of his direct state-court appeals. The Federal District Court held that Reese had not \"fairly presented\" his federal \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim to the higher state courts because his brief in the state appeals court had not indicated that he was complaining about a violation of federal law.\n\n\n5\nA divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court. 282 F. 3d 1184 (2002). Although the majority apparently believed that Reese's petition itself did not alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of the appellate \"ineffective assistance\" claim, it did not find that fact determinative. Id., at 1193-1194. Rather, it found that Reese had satisfied the \"fair presentation\" requirement because the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court had had \"the opportunity to read . . . the lower [Oregon] court decision claimed to be in error before deciding whether to grant discretionary review.\" Id., at 1194 (emphasis added). Had they read the opinion of the lower state trial court, the majority added, the justices would have, or should have, realized that Reese's claim rested upon federal law. Ibid.\n\n\n6\nWe granted certiorari to determine whether the Ninth Circuit has correctly interpreted the \"fair presentation\" requirement.\n\nII\n\n7\nWe begin by assuming that Reese's petition by itself did not properly alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of Reese's claim. On that assumption, Reese failed to meet the \"fair presentation\" standard, and the Ninth Circuit was wrong to hold the contrary.\n\n\n8\nWe recognize that the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court did have an \"opportunity\" to read the lower court opinions in Reese's case. That opportunity means that the judges could have read them. But to say that a petitioner \"fairly presents\" a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading lower court opinions in the case is to say that those judges must read the lower court opinions — for otherwise they would forfeit the State's opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance. In our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such a requirement.\n\n\n9\nFor one thing, the requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices. Appellate judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but they do not necessarily do so in every case. Sometimes an appellate court can decide a legal question on the basis of the briefs alone. That is particularly so where the question at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, i. e., whether to review the merits of a lower court decision. In such instances, the nature of the issue may matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court decision. And the nature of the issue alone may lead the court to decide not to hear the case. Indeed, the Oregon Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review. And Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7) (2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, \"including appropriate authorities.\"\n\n\n10\nFor another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers. Those courts have heavy workloads, which would be significantly increased if their judges had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance. See National Center for State Courts, State Court Caseload Statistics 2002, pp. 106-110 (Table 2) (for example, in 2001, Oregon appellate courts received a total of 5,341 appeals, including 908 petitions for discretionary review to its Supreme Court; California appellate courts received 32,273, including 8,860 discretionary Supreme Court petitions; Louisiana appellate courts received 13,117, including 3,230 discretionary Supreme Court petitions; Illinois appellate courts received 12,411, including 2,325 discretionary Supreme Court petitions).\n\n\n11\nFinally, we do not find such a requirement necessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus. A litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim \"federal.\"\n\n\n12\nFor these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut the considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote. We consequently hold that ordinarily a state prisoner does not \"fairly present\" a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so.\n\nIII\n\n13\nReese argues in the alternative that it is wrong to assume that his petition by itself failed to alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of his \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim. We do not agree.\n\n\n14\nReese must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that the words \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" refer to a federal claim. The petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to other claims but not in respect to this one. The petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the alleged federal nature of the claim. And the petition does not even contain a factual description supporting the claim. Cf. Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 163 (1996); Duncan, 513 U. S., at 366.\n\n\n15\nReese asserts that the petition nonetheless \"fairly presents\" a federal \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim for two reasons. First, he says that the word \"ineffective\" is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal-law claims and not to similar state-law claims, which, he adds, in Oregon are solely referred to as \"inadequate assistance\" claims. And thus the Oregon Supreme Court should have known, from his use of the word \"ineffective,\" that his claim was federal.\n\n\n16\nReese, however, has not demonstrated that Oregon law uses the words \"ineffective assistance\" in the manner he suggests, that is, as referring only to a federal-law claim. See, e. g., Lichau v. Baldwin, 166 Ore. App. 411, 415, 417, 999 P. 2d 1207, 1210, 1211 (2000) (using \"ineffective assistance\" to refer to violations of the Oregon Constitution), rev'd in part, 333 Ore. 350, 39 P. 3d 851 (2002). Indeed, Reese's own petition uses both phrases — \"ineffective assistance\" and \"inadequate assistance\" — at different points to refer to what is apparently a single claim.\n\n\n17\nSecond, Reese says that in Oregon the standards for adjudicating state and federal \"inadequate/ineffective appellate assistance\" claims are identical. He adds that, where that identity exists, a petitioner need not indicate a claim's federal nature, because, by raising a state-law claim, he would necessarily \"fairly present\" the corresponding federal claim.\n\n\n18\nHowever, the Ninth Circuit did not address this argument, and our reading of the briefs filed in the Ninth Circuit leads us to conclude that Reese did not there seek consideration of the argument in that court. Indeed, the argument first made its appearance in this Court in Reese's brief on the merits. Under this Court's Rule 15.2, \"a nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent's brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorari may be deemed waived.\" Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 75, n. 13 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). This argument falls squarely within the rule. The complex nature of Reese's claim and its broad implications suggest that its consideration by the lower courts would help in its resolution. Hence, without expressing any view on the merits of the issue, we exercise our Rule 15.2 discretion and deem the argument waived in this Court. See, e. g., Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1999) (per curiam); South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999); cf. Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 56, n. 4 (2002).\n\n\n19\nFor these reasons, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is\n\n\n20\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Briefs ofamici curiae urging reversal were filed for the State of Indiana et al. by Stephen R. Carter, Attorney General of Indiana, and Gary Damon Secrest, Deputy Attorney General, and by the Attorneys General for their respective States as follows: William H. Pryor, Jr., of Alabama, Bill Lockyer of California, Ken Salazar of Colorado, M. Jane Brady of Delaware, G.

McGraw, Jr., of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Crank of Wyoming; and for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation by Kent S. Scheidegger.\n\n\n\n21\nJUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.\n\n\n22\nIt is appropriate to disregard this Court's Rule 15.2 and permit respondents to defend a judgment on grounds not raised in the brief in opposition when the omitted issue is \"predicate to an intelligent resolution of the question presented.\" Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). I would do so in this case. Respondent satisfactorily demonstrates that there is no significant difference between an ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim predicated on the Oregon Constitution and one based on federal law. Brief for Respondent 29-35; see also Guinn v. Cupp, 304 Ore. 488, 495-496, 747 P. 2d 984, 988-989 (1988) (in banc). It is therefore clear that the state courts did have a fair opportunity to assess respondent's federal claim. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

HUFF, ET AL.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 11–208.   Decided January 23, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Petitioners Darin Ryburn and Edmundo Zepeda, along\nwith two other officers from the Burbank Police Depart-\nment, responded to a call from Bellarmine-Jefferson High\nSchool in Burbank, California. When the officers arrived\nat the school, the principal informed them that a stu-\ndent, Vincent Huff, was rumored to have written a letter\nthreatening to “shoot up” the school. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n2. The principal reported that many parents, after hear-\ning the rumor, had decided to keep their children at home.\nIbid. The principal expressed concern for the safety of her\nstudents and requested that the officers investigate the\nthreat. Id., at 42, 54–55.\n  In the course of conducting interviews with the principal\nand two of Vincent’s classmates, the officers learned that\nVincent had been absent from school for two days and\nthat he was frequently subjected to bullying. Id., at 2. The\nofficers additionally learned that one of Vincent’s class-\nmates believed that Vincent was capable of carrying out\nthe alleged threat. Id., at 44. The officers found Vincent’s\nabsences from school and his history of being subjected to\nbullying as cause for concern. The officers had received\ntraining on targeted school violence and were aware that\nthese characteristics are common among perpetrators of\nschool shootings. Id., at 56–58, 63.\n  The officers decided to continue the investigation by\ninterviewing Vincent. When the officers arrived at Vin-\ncent’s house, Officer Zepeda knocked on the door and\nannounced several times that the officers were with the\n2                     RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nBurbank Police Department. No one answered the door or\notherwise responded to Officer Zepeda’s knocks. Sergeant\nRyburn then called the home telephone. The officers could\nhear the phone ringing inside the house, but no one an-\nswered. Id., at 2.\n   Sergeant Ryburn next tried calling the cell phone of\nVincent’s mother, Mrs. Huff. When Mrs. Huff answered\nthe phone, Sergeant Ryburn identified himself and in-\nquired about her location. Mrs. Huff informed Sergeant\nRyburn that she was inside the house. Sergeant Ryburn\nthen inquired about Vincent’s location, and Mrs. Huff\ninformed him that Vincent was inside with her. Sergeant\nRyburn told Mrs. Huff that he and the other officers were\noutside and requested to speak with her, but Mrs. Huff\nhung up the phone. Id., at 2–3.\n   One or two minutes later, Mrs. Huff and Vincent walked\nout of the house and stood on the front steps. Officer\nZepeda advised Vincent that he and the other officers were\nthere to discuss the threats. Vincent, apparently aware of\nthe rumor that was circulating at his school, responded,\n“I can’t believe you’re here for that.” Id., at 3. Sergeant\nRyburn asked Mrs. Huff if they could continue the discus-\nsion inside the house, but she refused. Ibid. In Sergeant\nRyburn’s experience as a juvenile bureau sergeant, it was\n“extremely unusual” for a parent to decline an officer’s\nrequest to interview a juvenile inside. Id., at 3, 73–74.\nSergeant Ryburn also found it odd that Mrs. Huff never\nasked the officers the reason for their visit. Id., at 73–74.\n   After Mrs. Huff declined Sergeant Ryburn’s request to\ncontinue the discussion inside, Sergeant Ryburn asked her\nif there were any guns in the house. Mrs. Huff responded\nby “immediately turn[ing] around and r[unning] into the\nhouse.” Id., at 3. Sergeant Ryburn, who was “scared\nbecause [he] didn’t know what was in that house” and had\n“seen too many officers killed,” entered the house behind\nher. Id., at 75. Vincent entered the house behind Ser-\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The two remaining officers, who had been stand-\ning out of earshot while Sergeant Ryburn and Officer\nZepeda talked to Vincent and Mrs. Huff, entered the house\nlast, on the assumption that Mrs. Huff had given Sergeant\nRyburn and Officer Zepeda permission to enter. Id., at\n3–4.\n   Upon entering the house, the officers remained in the\nliving room with Mrs. Huff and Vincent. Eventually,\nVincent’s father entered the room and challenged the\nofficers’ authority to be there. The officers remained in-\nside the house for a total of 5 to 10 minutes. During that\ntime, the officers talked to Mr. Huff and Vincent. They\ndid not conduct any search of Mr. Huff, Mrs. Huff, or\nVincent, or any of their property. The officers ultimately\nconcluded that the rumor about Vincent was false, and\nthey reported their conclusion to the school. Id., at 4.\n   The Huffs brought this action against the officers under\nRev. Stat. §1979, 42 U.S. C. §1983. The complaint alleges\nthat the officers violated the Huffs’ Fourth Amendment\nrights by entering their home without a warrant. Follow-\ning a 2-day bench trial, the District Court entered judg-\nment in favor of the officers. The District Court resolved\nconflicting testimony regarding Mrs. Huff’s response to\nSergeant Ryburn’s inquiry about guns by finding that Mrs.\nHuff “immediately turned around and ran into the house.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 3. The District Court concluded that\nthe officers were entitled to qualified immunity because\nMrs. Huff’s odd behavior, combined with the information\nthe officers gathered at the school, could have led reason-\nable officers to believe “that there could be weapons inside\nthe house, and that family members or the officers them-\nselves were in danger.” Id., at 6. The District Court noted\nthat “[w]ithin a very short period of time, the officers were\n4                     RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nconfronted with facts and circumstances giving rise to\ngrave concern about the nature of the danger they were\nconfronting.” Id., at 6–7. With respect to this kind of\n“rapidly evolving incident,” the District Court explained,\ncourts should be especially reluctant “to fault the police for\nnot obtaining a warrant.” Id., at 7.\n   A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Dis-\ntrict Court as to the two officers who entered the house on\nthe assumption that Mrs. Huff had consented, but re-\nversed as to petitioners. The majority upheld the District\nCourt’s findings of fact, but disagreed with the District\nCourt’s conclusion that petitioners were entitled to quali-\nfied immunity. The majority acknowledged that police\nofficers are allowed to enter a home without a warrant if\nthey reasonably believe that immediate entry is necessary\nto protect themselves or others from serious harm, even if\nthe officers lack probable cause to believe that a crime has\nbeen or is about to be committed. Id., at 24. But the\nmajority determined that, in this case, “any belief that\nthe officers or other family members were in serious, im-\nminent harm would have been objectively unreasonable”\ngiven that “[Mrs. Huff] merely asserted her right to end\nher conversation with the officers and returned to her\nhome.” Id., at 25.\n   Judge Rawlinson dissented. She explained that “the\ndiscrete incident that precipitated the entry in this case\nwas Mrs. Huff’s response to the question regarding wheth-\ner there were guns in the house.” Id., at 31. She faulted\nthe majority for “recit[ing] a sanitized account of this\nevent” that differed markedly from the District Court’s\nfindings of fact, which the majority had conceded must be\ncredited. Judge Rawlinson looked to “cases that specifi-\ncally address the scenario where officer safety concerns\nprompted the entry” and concluded that, under the ra-\ntionale articulated in those cases, “a police officer could\nhave reasonably believed that he was justified in making a\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nwarrantless entry to ensure that no one inside the house\nhad a gun after Mrs. Huff ran into the house without\nanswering the question of whether anyone had a weapon.”\nId., at 31, 33, 37.\n   Judge Rawlinson’s analysis of the qualified immunity\nissue was correct. No decision of this Court has found a\nFourth Amendment violation on facts even roughly com-\nparable to those present in this case. On the contrary,\nsome of our opinions may be read as pointing in the oppo-\nsition direction.\n   In Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 400 (2006), we\nheld that officers may enter a residence without a warrant\nwhen they have “an objectively reasonable basis for believ-\ning that an occupant is . . . imminently threatened with\n[serious injury].” We explained that “ ‘[t]he need to protect\nor preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification\nfor what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or\nemergency.’ ” Id., at 403 (quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437\nU.S. 385, 392 (1978)). In addition, in Georgia v. Ran-\ndolph, 547 U.S. 103, 118 (2006), the Court stated that “it\nwould be silly to suggest that the police would commit a\ntort by entering [a residence] . . . to determine whether\nviolence . . . is about to (or soon will) occur.”\n   A reasonable police officer could read these decisions to\nmean that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to en-\nter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for\nconcluding that there is an imminent threat of violence.\nIn this case, the District Court concluded that petitioners\nhad such an objectively reasonable basis for reaching such\na conclusion. The District Court wrote:\n    “[T]he officers testified that a number of factors led\n    them to be concerned for their own safety and for the\n    safety of other persons in the residence: the unusual\n    behavior of the parents in not answering the door or\n    the telephone; the fact that Mrs. Huff did not inquire\n6                    RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n    about the reason for their visit or express concern that\n    they were investigating her son; the fact that she\n    hung up the telephone on the officer; the fact that\n    she refused to tell them whether there were guns in\n    the house; and finally, the fact that she ran back into\n    the house while being questioned. That behavior,\n    combined with the information obtained at the\n    school—that Vincent was a student who was a victim\n    of bullying, who had been absent from school for two\n    days, and who had threatened to ‘shoot up’ the\n    school—led the officers to believe that there could be\n    weapons inside the house, and that family members\n    or the officers themselves were in danger.” App. to\n    Pet. for Cert. 6.\nThis belief, the District Court held, was “objectively rea-\nsonable,” particularly since the situation was “rapidly\nevolving” and the officers had to make quick decisions.\nId., at 6–7.\n   The panel majority—far removed from the scene and\nwith the opportunity to dissect the elements of the situa-\ntion—confidently concluded that the officers really had no\nreason to fear for their safety or that of anyone else. As\nthe panel majority saw things, it was irrelevant that the\nHuffs did not respond when the officers knocked on the\ndoor and announced their presence and when they called\nthe home phone because the Huffs had no legal obligation\nto respond to a knock on the door or to answer the phone.\nThe majority attributed no significance to the fact that,\nwhen the officers finally reached Mrs. Huff on her cell\nphone, she abruptly hung up in the middle of their conver-\nsation. And, according to the majority, the officers should\nnot have been concerned by Mrs. Huff’s reaction when\nthey asked her if there were any guns in the house be-\ncause Mrs. Huff “merely asserted her right to end her\nconversation with the officers and returned to her home.”\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nId., at 25.\n   Confronted with the facts found by the District Court,\nreasonable officers in the position of petitioners could have\ncome to the conclusion that there was an imminent threat\nto their safety and to the safety of others. The Ninth\nCircuit’s contrary conclusion was flawed for numerous\nreasons.\n   First, although the panel majority purported to accept\nthe findings of the District Court, it changed those find-\nings in several key respects. As Judge Rawlinson correctly\nobserved, “the discrete incident that precipitated the entry\nin this case was Mrs. Huff’s response to the question\nregarding whether there were guns in the house.” Id., at\n31. The District Court’s finding that Mrs. Huff “immedi-\nately turned around and ran into the house” implicitly\nrejected Mrs. Huff’s contrary testimony that she walked\ninto the house after telling the officers that she was going\nto get her husband. Id., at 3. The panel majority upheld\nthe District Court’s findings of fact and acknowledged that\nit could not reverse the District Court simply because it\n“may have weighed the testimony of the witnesses and\nother evidence in another manner.” Id., at 15. But the\npanel majority’s determination that petitioners were not\nentitled to qualified immunity rested on an account of\nthe facts that differed markedly from the District Court’s\nfinding. According to the panel majority, Mrs. Huff “mere-\nly asserted her right to end her conversation with the\nofficers and returned to her home” after telling the officers\n“that she would go get her husband.” Id., at 12, 25.\n   Second, the panel majority appears to have taken the\nview that conduct cannot be regarded as a matter of con-\ncern so long as it is lawful. Accordingly, the panel ma-\njority concluded that Mrs. Huff’s response to the question\nwhether there were any guns in the house (immediately\nturning around and running inside) was not a reason for\nalarm because she was under no legal obligation to con-\n8                     RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ntinue her conversation with the police. It should go with-\nout saying, however, that there are many circumstances in\nwhich lawful conduct may portend imminent violence.\n   Third, the panel majority’s method of analyzing the\nstring of events that unfolded at the Huff residence was\nentirely unrealistic. The majority looked at each separate\nevent in isolation and concluded that each, in itself, did\nnot give cause for concern. But it is a matter of common\nsense that a combination of events each of which is mun-\ndane when viewed in isolation may paint an alarming\npicture.\n   Fourth, the panel majority did not heed the District\nCourt’s wise admonition that judges should be cautious\nabout second-guessing a police officer’s assessment, made\non the scene, of the danger presented by a particular\nsituation. With the benefit of hindsight and calm deliber-\nation, the panel majority concluded that it was unreason-\nable for petitioners to fear that violence was imminent.\nBut we have instructed that reasonableness “must be\njudged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the\nscene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight” and\nthat “[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allow-\nance for the fact that police officers are often forced to\nmake split-second judgments—in circumstances that are\ntense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.” Graham v. Con-\nnor, 490 U.S. 386, 396–397 (1989). Judged from the\nproper perspective of a reasonable officer forced to make a\nsplit-second decision in response to a rapidly unfolding\nchain of events that culminated with Mrs. Huff turning\nand running into the house after refusing to answer a\nquestion about guns, petitioners’ belief that entry was\nnecessary to avoid injury to themselves or others was im-\nminently reasonable.\n   In sum, reasonable police officers in petitioners’ position\ncould have come to the conclusion that the Fourth\nAmendment permitted them to enter the Huff residence if\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  9\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthere was an objectively reasonable basis for fearing that\nviolence was imminent. And a reasonable officer could\nhave come to such a conclusion based on the facts as found\nby the District Court.\n  The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of\nthe Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nthe entry of judgment in favor of petitioners.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

STEVE HARRIS, ET AL.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 15–278.   Decided January 25, 2016\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The Court considers for the second time the Ninth Cir-\ncuit’s determination that respondent stockholders’ com-\nplaint states a claim against petitioner fiduciaries for\nbreach of the duty of prudence. The first time, the Court\nvacated and remanded in light of Fifth Third Bancorp v.\nDudenhoeffer, 573 U. S. ___ (2014), a case which set forth\nthe standards for stating a claim for breach of the duty of\nprudence against fiduciaries who manage employee stock\nownership plans (ESOPs). On remand, the Ninth Circuit\nreiterated its conclusion that the complaint states such a\nclaim. The Court now reverses and remands.\n   The stockholders are former employees of Amgen Inc.\nand its subsidiary Amgen Manufacturing, Limited, who\nparticipated in plans that qualified under 29 U.S. C.\n§1107(d)(3)(A) as eligible individual account plans. Like\nESOPs, these plans offer ownership in employer stock as\nan option to employees. The parties agree that the deci-\nsion in Fifth Third is fully applicable to the plans at issue\nhere. See 788 F.3d 916, 935 (2014).\n   All of the plans had holdings in the Amgen Common\nStock Fund (composed, unsurprisingly, of Amgen common\nstock) during the relevant period. The value of Amgen\nstock fell, and in 2007, the stockholders filed a class action\nagainst petitioner fiduciaries alleging that they had\nbreached their fiduciary duties, including the duty of\nprudence, under the Employee Retirement Income Secur-\nity Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29\nU.S. C. §1001 et seq. The District Court granted the\n2                   AMGEN INC. v. HARRIS\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nfiduciaries’ motion to dismiss, and the Ninth Circuit re-\nversed, Harris v. Amgen, Inc., 738 F.3d 1026 (2013). The\nfiduciaries sought certiorari.\n   While that petition was pending, this Court issued a\ndecision that concerned the duty of prudence owed by\nERISA fiduciaries who administer ESOPs. That decision,\nFifth Third, held that such ERISA fiduciaries are not\nentitled to a presumption of prudence but are “subject to\nthe same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciar-\nies in general, except that they need not diversify the\nfund’s assets.” 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1–2).\n   Notwithstanding the lack of a presumption of prudence,\nFifth Third noted that “Congress sought to encourage the\ncreation of ” employee stock-ownership plans, id., at ___\n(slip op., at 14), a purpose that the decision recognized\nmay come into tension with ERISA’s general duty of pru-\ndence. Moreover, ESOP fiduciaries confront unique chal-\nlenges given “the potential for conflict” that arises when\nfiduciaries are alleged to have imprudently “fail[ed] to act\non inside information they had about the value of the\nemployer’s stock.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Fifth Third\ntherefore laid out standards to help “divide the plausible\nsheep from the meritless goats,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 15):\n    “To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence on\n    the basis of inside information, a plaintiff must plau-\n    sibly allege an alternative action that the defendant\n    could have taken that would have been consistent\n    with the securities laws and that a prudent fiduciary\n    in the same circumstances would not have viewed as\n    more likely to harm the fund than to help it.” Id., at\n    ___ (slip op., at 18).\nIt further clarified that courts should determine whether\nthe complaint itself states a claim satisfying that liability\nstandard:\n    “[L]ower courts faced with such claims should also\n                 Cite as: 577 U. S. ____ (2016)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n    consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged\n    that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant’s position\n    could not have concluded that stopping purchases—\n    which the market might take as a sign that insider fi-\n    duciaries viewed the employer’s stock as a bad in-\n    vestment—or publicly disclosing negative information\n    would do more harm than good to the fund by causing\n    a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in\n    the value of the stock already held by the fund.” Id.,\n    at ___ (slip op., at 20) (emphasis added).\n   In the matter that is once again before the Court here,\nfollowing the issuance of Fifth Third, the Court granted\nthe fiduciaries’ first petition for a writ of certiorari, va-\ncated the judgment, and remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with that decision. Amgen Inc. v. Harris, 576\nU. S. ___ (2014). On remand, the Ninth Circuit reversed\nagain the dismissal of the complaint and denied the fidu-\nciaries’ petition for rehearing en banc. See 788 F.3d 916.\nThe fiduciaries once more sought certiorari.\n   The Court now holds that the Ninth Circuit failed to\nproperly evaluate the complaint. That court explained\nthat its previous opinion (that is, the one it issued before\nFifth Third was decided) “had already assumed” the\nstandards for ERISA fiduciary liability laid out by this\nCourt in Fifth Third. 788 F.3d, at 940. And it reasoned\nthat the complaint at issue here satisfies those standards\nbecause when “the federal securities laws require disclo-\nsure of material information,” it is “quite plausible” that\nremoving the Amgen Common Stock Fund “from the list of\ninvestment options” would not “caus[e] undue harm to\nplan participants.” Id., at 937–938. The Ninth Circuit,\nhowever, failed to assess whether the complaint in its\ncurrent form “has plausibly alleged” that a prudent fiduci-\nary in the same position “could not have concluded” that\nthe alternative action “would do more harm than good.”\n4                  AMGEN INC. v. HARRIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nFifth Third, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20).\n  The Ninth Circuit’s proposition that removing the\nAmgen Common Stock Fund from the list of investment\noptions was an alternative action that could plausibly\nhave satisfied Fifth Third’s standards may be true. If so,\nthe facts and allegations supporting that proposition\nshould appear in the stockholders’ complaint. Having\nexamined the complaint, the Court has not found suffi-\ncient facts and allegations to state a claim for breach of\nthe duty of prudence.\n  Although the Ninth Circuit did not correctly apply Fifth\nThird, the stockholders are the masters of their complaint.\nThe Court leaves to the District Court in the first instance\nwhether the stockholders may amend it in order to ade-\nquately plead a claim for breach of the duty of prudence\nguided by the standards provided in Fifth Third.\n  The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of\nthe Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

NACHTIGAL.\nNo. 92-609.\nFeb. 22, 1993.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nRespondent Jerry Nachtigal was charged with operating a motor vehicle in Yosemite National Park while under the influence of alcohol, in violation of 36 CFR §§ 4.23(a)(1) and (a)(2) (1992). Driving under the influence (DUI) is a class B misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment, § 1.3(a); 18 U.S.C. § 3581(b)(7), and a $5,000 fine, §§ 3571(b)(6) and (e). As an alternative to a term of imprisonment, the sentencing court may impose a term of probation not to exceed five years.  §§ 3561(a)(3), (b)(2).  The sentencing court has discretion to attach a host of discretionary conditions to the probationary term.  § 3563(b).\n\n\n2\nRespondent moved for a jury trial.  Applying our decision in Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U.S. 538, 109 S.Ct. 1289, 103 L.Ed.2d 550 (1989), the Magistrate Judge denied the motion.  He reasoned that because DUI carries a maximum term of imprisonment of six months, it is presumptively a \"petty\" offense which is not embraced by the jury trial guaranty of the Sixth Amendment.  He rejected respondent's contention that the additional penalties transformed DUI into a \"serious\" offense for Sixth Amendment purposes.  Respondent was then tried by the Magistrate Judge and convicted of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol in violation of 36 CFR § 4.23(a)(1) (1992).  He was fined $750.00 and placed on unsupervised probation for one year.\n\n\n3\nThe District Court reversed the magistrate judge on the issue of entitlement to a jury trial, commenting that the language in our opinion in Blanton was \"at variance with the Ninth Circuit precedent of United States v. Craner, [652 F.2d 23 (1981) ],\" and electing to follow Craner because our opinion in Blanton did not \"expressly overrule\" Craner.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a, 20a.\n\n\n4\nThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the District Court, holding that Blanton is \"[in]apposite,\" that Craner controls, and that respondent is entitled to a jury trial. App. to Pet. for Cert., at 3a-4a, judgt. order reported at 953 F.2d 1389 (1992).  The Court of Appeals reasoned that since the Secretary of the Interior, and not Congress, set the maximum prison term at six months, \"[t]here is no controlling legislative determination\" regarding the seriousness of the offense.  Id., at 4a;  see also United States v. Craner, 652 F.2d 23, 25 (C.A.9 1981).  The court also found it significant that the Secretary of the Interior, in whom Congress vested general regulatory authority to fix six months as the maximum sentence for any regulatory offense dealing with the use and management of the national parks, monuments, or reservations, see 16 U.S.C. § 3, chose the harshest penalty available for DUI offenses.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a-4a; see also Craner, supra, at 25.  Finally, the court noted that seven of the nine States within the Ninth Circuit guarantee a jury trial for a DUI offense.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a-4a;  see also Craner, supra, at 27.\n\n\n5\nUnlike the Court of Appeals and the District Court, we think that this case is quite obviously controlled by our decision in Blanton.  We therefore grant the United States' petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.\n\n\n6\nIn Blanton, we held that in order to determine whether the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial attaches to a particular offense, the court must examine \"objective indications of the seriousness with which society regards the offense.\"  Blanton, 489 U.S., at 541, 109 S.Ct., at 1292 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The best indicator of society's views is the maximum penalty set by the legislature.  Ibid.  While the word \"penalty\" refers both to the term of imprisonment and other statutory penalties, we stated that \"[p]rimary emphasis . . . must be placed on the maximum authorized period of incarceration.\"  Id., at 542, 109 S.Ct., at 1292.  We therefore held that offenses for which the maximum period of incarceration is six months or less are presumptively \"petty.\"  A defendant can overcome this presumption, and become entitled to a jury trial, only by showing that the additional penalties, viewed together with the maximum prison term, are so severe that the legislature clearly determined that the offense is a \"serious\" one.  Id., at 543, 109 S.Ct., at 1293. Finally, we expressly stated that the statutory penalties in other States are irrelevant to the question whether a particular legislature deemed a particular offense \"serious.\"  Id., at 545, n. 11, 109 S.Ct., at 1294, n. 11.\n\n\n7\nApplying the above rule, we held that DUI was a petty offense under Nevada law.  Since the maximum prison term was six months, the presumption described above applied.  We did not find it constitutionally significant that the defendant would automatically lose his license for up to 90 days, and would be required to attend, at his own expense, an alcohol abuse education course.  Id., at 544, and n. 9, 109 S.Ct., at 1293, and n. 9.  Nor did we believe that a $1,000 fine or an alternative sentence of 48 hours' community service while wearing clothing identifying him as a DUI offender was more onerous than six months in jail.  Id., at 544-545, 109 S.Ct., at 1293-1294.\n\n\n8\nThe present case, we think, requires only a relatively routine application of the rule announced in Blanton.  Because the maximum term of imprisonment is six months, DUI under 36 CFR § 4.23(a)(1) (1992) is presumptively a petty offense to which no jury trial right attaches.  The Court of Appeals refused to apply the Blanton presumption, reasoning that the Secretary of the Interior, and not Congress, ultimately determined the maximum prison term.  But there is a controlling legislative determination present within the regulatory scheme.  In 16 U.S.C. § 3, Congress set six months as the maximum penalty the Secretary could impose for a violation of any of his regulations.  The Court of Appeals offered no persuasive reason why this congressional determination is stripped of its \"legislative\" character merely because the Secretary has final authority to decide, within the limits given by Congress, what the maximum prison sentence will be for a violation of a given regulation.\n\n\n9\nThe additional penalties imposed under the regulations are not sufficiently severe to overcome this presumption.  As we noted in Blanton, it is a rare case where \"a legislature packs an offense it deems 'serious' with onerous penalties that nonetheless do not puncture the 6-month incarceration line.\"  Blanton, 489 U.S., at 543, 109 S.Ct., at 1293 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, the federal DUI offense carries a maximum fine of $5,000, and respondent faced, as an alternative to incarceration, a maximum 5-year term of probation.  While the maximum fine in this case is $4,000 greater than the one in Blanton, this monetary penalty \"cannot approximate in severity the loss of liberty that a prison term entails.\"  Id., at 542, 109 S.Ct., at 1292.\n\n\n10\nNor do we believe that the parole alternative renders the DUI offense \"serious.\"*  Like a monetary penalty, the liberty infringement caused by a term of probation is far less intrusive than incarceration.  Ibid.  The discretionary probation conditions do not alter this conclusion;  while they obviously entail a greater infringement on liberty than probation without attendant conditions, they do not approximate the severe loss of liberty caused by imprisonment for more than six months.\n\n\n11\nWe hold that the Court of Appeals was wrong in refusing to recognize that this case was controlled by our opinion in Blanton rather than by its previous opinion in Craner.  An individual convicted of driving under the influence in violation of 36 CFR § 4.23(a)(1) (1992) is not constitutionally entitled to a jury trial.  The petition of the United States for certiorari is accordingly granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n12\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n There are 21 discretionary conditions which the sentencing court may impose upon a defendant.  Under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b), a court may require, among other things, that the defendant (1) pay restitution;  (2) take part in a drug and alcohol dependency program offered by an institution, and if necessary, reside at the institution;  (3) remain in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons during nights and weekends for a period not exceeding the term of imprisonment;  (4) reside at or participate in a program of a community correctional facility for all or part of the probationary term;  or (5) remain at his place of residence during nonworking hours, and, if necessary, this condition may be monitored by telephonic or electronic devices.  §§ 3563(b)(3), (b)(10), (b)(11), (b)(12), (b)(20).\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Johnson.\nNo. 91-779.\nArgued April 20, 1992.\nDecided June 12, 1992.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nRespondents sued petitioner, their employer, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in the state court in Yellowstone County, Montana.  That court denied petitioner's motions to change venue to Hill County, where petitioner claimed to have its principal place of business in Montana.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, ruling that Montana's venue rules—which permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit in any county against a corporation, like petitioner, that is incorporated elsewhere—do not work a discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\nHeld:  The distinction in treatment contained in Montana's venue rules does not offend the Equal Protection Clause.  Those rules neither deprive petitioner of a fundamental right nor classify along suspect lines like race or religion, and are valid because they can be understood as rationally furthering a legitimate state interest:  adjustment of the disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place of trial.  Montana could reasonably determine that only the convenience to a corporate defendant of litigating in the county of its home office outweighs a plaintiff's interest in suing in the county of his choice. Petitioner has not shown that the Montana venue rules' hinging on State of incorporation rather than domicile makes them so under- or overinclusive as to be irrational.  Besides, petitioner, being domiciled outside Montana, would not benefit from a rule turning on domicile, and therefore cannot complain of a rule hinging on State of incorporation.  Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U.S. 490, 47 S.Ct. 678, 71 L.Ed. 1165, distinguished.  Pp. 2185-2188.\n--- Mont. ----, 819 P.2d 169 (1991), affirmed.\nSOUTER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nBetty Jo Christian, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nJoel I. Klein, Washington, D.C., for respondents.\nJustice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nMontana's venue rules permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit in any county against a corporation incorporated elsewhere.  This case presents the question whether the distinction in treatment offends the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. Amdt. 14, § 1.  We hold that it does not.\n\n\n2\nRespondents William D. Ford and Thomas L. Johnson were employed by petitioner Burlington Northern Railroad Company, a corporation owing its existence to the laws of Delaware and having a principal place of business in Fort Worth, Texas.  Ford and Johnson raised a claim under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. §§ 51-60, and brought suit in the state trial court for Yellowstone County, Montana, alleging injuries sustained while working at Burlington's premises in Sheridan, Wyoming.  In each case, Burlington moved to change venue to Hill County, Montana, where it claimed to have its principal place of business in that State.  The trial court denied each motion, and Burlington brought interlocutory appeals.\n\n\n3\nThe Supreme Court of Montana consolidated the two cases and affirmed the decisions of the trial court.  --- Mont. ----, 819 P.2d 169 (1991).  Under the Montana venue rules, the court said, a foreign corporation may be sued in any of Montana's counties. Id., at ----, 819 P.2d, at 171.  The court rejected Burlington's argument that the State's venue rules worked a discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  The Montana venue rules, the court explained, were subject merely to rational-basis review, id., at ----, 819 P.2d, at 173, which was satisfied, at least in these cases, by the consonance of the rules with federal policy, embodied in FELA, of facilitating recovery by injured railroad workers, id., at ---- - ----, 819 P.2d, at 173-174.  Besides, the court said, Montana's venue rules did not even discriminate against Burlington, since Ford and Johnson could have sued the corporation in the Federal District Court for Montana, which sits in Yellowstone County, among other places. Id., at ----, 819 P.2d, at 175.  We granted certiorari, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 964, 117 L.Ed.2d 130 (1992), and, although our reasoning differs from that of the State Supreme Court, now affirm.*\n\n\n4\nA Montana statute provides that \"the proper place of trial for all civil actions is the county in which the defendants or any of them may reside at the commencement of the action.\"  Mont.Code Ann. § 25-2-118(1) (1991).  But, \"if none of the defendants reside in the state, the proper place of trial is any county the plaintiff designates in the complaint.\"  § 25-2-118(2).  The Supreme Court of Montana has long held that a corporation does not \"reside in the state\" for venue purposes unless Montana is its State of incorporation, see, e.g., Haug v. Burlington Northern R. Co., 236 Mont. 368, 371, 770 P.2d 517, 519 (1989);  Foley v. General Motors Corp., 159 Mont. 469, 472-473, 499 P.2d 774, 776 (1972);  Hanlon v. Great Northern R. Co., 83 Mont. 15, 21, 268 P. 547, 549 (1928);  Pue v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 78 Mont. 40, 43, 252 P. 313, 315 (1926), and that a Montana corporation resides in the Montana county in which it has its principal place of business, see, e.g., Mapston v. Joint School District No. 8, 227 Mont. 521, 523, 740 P.2d 676, 677 (1987);  Platt v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 222 Mont. 184, 187, 721 P.2d 336, 338 (1986).  In combination, these venue rules, with exceptions not here relevant, permit a plaintiff to sue a domestic company in just the one county where it has its principal place of business, while a plaintiff may sue a foreign corporation in any of the State's 56 counties.  Burlington claims the distinction offends the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n\n5\nThe Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State to \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1.  Because the Montana venue rules neither deprive Burlington of a fundamental right nor classify along suspect lines like race or religion, they do not deny equal protection to Burlington unless they fail in rationally furthering legitimate state ends.  See, e.g., United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U.S. 52, 64, 110 S.Ct. 387, 396, 107 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989); Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 1595, 104 L.Ed.2d 18 (1989).\n\n\n6\nVenue rules generally reflect equity or expediency in resolving disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place of trial.  See, e.g., Citizens & Southern National Bank v. Bougas, 434 U.S. 35, 44, n. 10, 98 S.Ct. 88, 94, n. 10, 54 L.Ed.2d 218 (1977);  Denver & R.G.W.R. Co. v. Trainmen, 387 U.S. 556, 560, 87 S.Ct. 1746, 1748, 18 L.Ed.2d 954 (1967);  Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 623, 84 S.Ct. 805, 812, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964);  F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure 47 (3d ed. 1985).  The forum preferable to one party may be undesirable to another, and the adjustment of such warring interests is a valid state concern. Cf. United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 178, 101 S.Ct. 453, 461, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980).  In striking the balance between them, a State may have a number of choices, any of which would survive scrutiny, each of them passable under the standard tolerating some play in the joints of governmental machinery.  See Bain Peanut Co. of Texas v. Pinson, 282 U.S. 499, 501, 51 S.Ct. 228, 229, 75 L.Ed. 482 (1931).  Thus, we have no doubt that a State would act within its constitutional prerogatives if it were to give so much weight to the interests of plaintiffs as to allow them to sue in the counties of their choice under all circumstances.  It is equally clear that a State might temper such an \"any county\" rule to the extent a reasonable assessment of defendants' interests so justified.\n\n\n7\nHere, Montana has decided that the any-county rule should give way to a single-county rule where a defendant resides in Montana, arguably on the reasonable ground that a defendant should not be subjected to a plaintiff's tactical advantage of forcing a trial far from the defendant's residence.  At the same time, Montana has weighed the interest of a defendant who does not reside in Montana differently, arguably on the equally reasonable ground that for most nonresident defendants the inconvenience will be great whether they have to defend in, say, Billings or Havre. See Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U.S. 490, 498, 47 S.Ct. 678, 681, 71 L.Ed. 1165 (1927) (Holmes, J., dissenting). Montana could thus have decided that a nonresident defendant's interest in convenience is too slight to outweigh the plaintiff's interest in suing in the forum of his choice.\n\n\n8\nBurlington does not, indeed, seriously contend that such a decision is constitutionally flawed as applied to individual nonresident defendants.  Nor does it argue that such a rule is unconstitutional even when applied to corporate defendants without a fixed place of business in Montana.  Burlington does claim, however, that the rule is unconstitutional as applied to a corporate defendant like Burlington that not only has its home office in some other State or country, but also has a place of business in Montana that would qualify as its \"principal place of business\" if it were a Montana corporation.\n\n\n9\nBurlington's claim fails.  Montana could reasonably have determined that a corporate defendant's home office is generally of greater significance to the corporation's convenience in litigation than its other offices;  that foreign corporations are unlikely to have their principal offices in Montana;  and that Montana's domestic corporations will probably keep headquarters within the State.  We cannot say, at least not on this record, that any of these assumptions is irrational.  Cf. G.D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U.S. 404, 410, 102 S.Ct. 1137, 1142, 71 L.Ed.2d 250 (1982);  Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U.S. 580, 585, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540, 79 L.Ed. 1070 (1935).  And upon them Montana may have premised the policy judgment, which we find constitutionally unimpeachable, that only the convenience to a corporate defendant of litigating in the county containing its home office is sufficiently significant to outweigh a plaintiff's interest in suing in the county of his choice.\n\n\n10\nOf course Montana's venue rules would have implemented that policy judgment with greater precision if they had turned on the location of a corporate defendant's principal place of business, not on its State of incorporation.  But this is hardly enough to make the rules fail rational-basis review, for \"rational distinctions may be made with substantially less than mathematical exactitude.\"  New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2517, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976);  see Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 814, 96 S.Ct. 2488, 2500, 49 L.Ed.2d 220 (1976);  Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61, 78, 31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369 (1911).  Montana may reasonably have thought that the location of a corporate defendant's principal place of business would not be as readily verifiable as its State of incorporation, that a rule hinging on the former would invite wasteful side shows of venue litigation, and that obviating the side shows would be worth the loss in precision.  These possibilities, of course, put Burlington a far cry away from the point of discharging its burden of showing that the under- and overinclusiveness of Montana's venue rules is so great that the rules can no longer be said rationally to implement Montana's policy judgment.  See, e.g., Brownell, supra, 294 U.S., at 584, 55 S.Ct., at 540.  Besides, Burlington, having headquarters elsewhere, would not benefit even from a scheme based on domicile, and is therefore in no position to complain of Montana's using State of incorporation as a surrogate for domicile.  See Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, 271 U.S. 50, 53-55, 46 S.Ct. 375, 376-377, 70 L.Ed. 827 (1926);  cf. United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 522, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960).\n\n\n11\nBurlington is left with the argument that Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, supra, controls this case.  But it does not.  In Saunders, we considered Arkansas' venue rules, which restricted suit against a domestic corporation to those counties where it maintained a place of business, 274 U.S., at 491-492, 47 S.Ct., at 678-679, but exposed foreign corporations to suit in any county, id., at 492, 47 S.Ct., at 679.  We held that the distinction lacked a rational basis and therefore deprived foreign corporate defendants of the equal protection of the laws.  Id., at 494, 47 S.Ct., at 679.  The statutory provision challenged in Saunders, however, applied only to foreign corporations authorized to do business in Arkansas, ibid., so that most of the corporations subject to its any-county rule probably had a place of business in Arkansas.  In contrast, most of the corporations subject to Montana's any-county rule probably do not have their principal place of business in Montana.  Thus, Arkansas' special rule for foreign corporations was tailored with significantly less precision than Montana's, and, on the assumption that Saunders is still good law, see American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Starnes, 425 U.S. 637, 645, n. 6, 96 S.Ct. 1800, 1805, n. 6, 48 L.Ed.2d 263 (1976), its holding does not invalidate Montana's venue rules.\n\n\n12\nIn sum, Montana's venue rules can be understood as rationally furthering a legitimate state interest.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is accordingly\n\n\n13\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The decision below is final for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1257(a).  See American Motorists Ins. Co. v.

S. C. § 1983. Where a prisoner's § 1983 action would implicitly question the conviction's validity or sentence's duration, the litigant must first achieve favorable termination of his available state, or federal habeas, opportunities to challenge the underlying conviction or sentence. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477. Heck has been applied in a § 1983 challenge to a prison's administrative action that could affect a prisoner's credits toward release based on good-time served, Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641, but is not implicated by a challenge that threatens no consequence for a prisoner's conviction or his sentence's duration. Here, prison rules required prehearing detention when petitioner Muhammad, an inmate, was charged with \"threatening behavior\" in the aftermath of a confrontation with respondent Close, a prison official. Muhammad was acquitted of threatening behavior at a hearing six days later, but was found guilty of insolence, for which prehearing detention would not have been mandatory. He then filed this § 1983 action, alleging that Close had charged him with threatening behavior (subjecting him to prehearing lockup) in retaliation for prior lawsuits and grievance proceedings against Close. His amended complaint did not challenge his insolence conviction, or the hearing, and did not seek to expunge the misconduct finding, seeking only damages for alleged physical, mental, and emotional injuries sustained during his prehearing detention. Accepting the Magistrate Judge's recommendation, the District Court granted Close summary judgment on the ground that Muhammad had failed to present sufficient evidence of retaliation to raise a material fact as to that element. In affirming, the Sixth Circuit found the action barred by Heck because Muhammad had sought expungement of the misconduct charge from the prison record when he could seek such relief only after satisfying Heck's favorable termination requirement.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit's decision was flawed as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. In making the erroneous factual finding that Muhammad had sought to expunge the misconduct charge from his prison record, the court simply overlooked his amended complaint that sought no such relief. This error was compounded by the court's mistaken view that Heck applies categorically to all suits challenging prison disciplinary proceedings. The administrative determinations here do not raise any implication about the conviction's validity and do not necessarily affect the duration of time to be served. The effect of disciplinary proceedings on good-time credits is a matter of state law or regulation, and in this case, the Magistrate Judge expressly found or assumed that no such credits were eliminated by the challenged prehearing action. Because Muhammad raised no claim on which habeas relief could have been granted, Heck's favorable termination requirement does not apply. Having previously failed to challenge the Magistrate Judge's decision that good-time credits were not affected by the allegedly retaliatory overcharge of threatening behavior and consequential prehearing detention, Close has waived the 11th-hour contention that Heck is squarely on point.\n47 Fed. Appx. 738, reversed and remanded.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.\nCorinne Beckwith, by appointment of the Court, 539 U. S. 925, argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the brief were James W. Klein, Samia Fam, and Giovanna Shay.\nThomas L. Casey, Solicitor General of Michigan, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs were Michael A. Cox, Attorney General, and Linda M. Olivieri and Kevin Himebaugh*\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\n* Federal law opens two main avenues to relief on complaints related to imprisonment: a petition for habeas corpus, 28 U. S. C. § 2254, and a complaint under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. § 1979, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1983. Challenges to the validity of any confinement or to particulars affecting its duration are the province of habeas corpus, Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 500 (1973); requests for relief turning on circumstances of confinement may be presented in a § 1983 action. Some cases are hybrids, with a prisoner seeking relief unavailable in habeas, notably damages, but on allegations that not only support a claim for recompense, but imply the invalidity either of an underlying conviction or of a particular ground for denying release short of serving the maximum term of confinement. In Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), we held that where success in a prisoner's § 1983 damages action would implicitly question the validity of conviction or duration of sentence, the litigant must first achieve favorable termination of his available state, or federal habeas, opportunities to challenge the underlying conviction or sentence. Accordingly, in Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641 (1997), we applied Heck in the circumstances of a § 1983 action claiming damages and equitable relief for a procedural defect in a prison's administrative process, where the administrative action taken against the plaintiff could affect credits toward release based on good time served. In each instance, conditioning the right to bring a § 1983 action on a favorable result in state litigation or federal habeas served the practical objective of preserving limitations on the availability of habeas remedies. Federal petitions for habeas corpus may be granted only after other avenues of relief have been exhausted. 28 U. S. C. § 2254(b)(1)(A). See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982). Prisoners suing under § 1983, in contrast, generally face a substantially lower gate, even with the requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that administrative opportunities be exhausted first. 42 U. S. C. § 1997e(a).\n\n\n2\nHeck's requirement to resort to state litigation and federal habeas before § 1983 is not, however, implicated by a prisoner's challenge that threatens no consequence for his conviction or the duration of his sentence.1 There is no need to preserve the habeas exhaustion rule and no impediment under Heck in such a case, of which this is an example.2\n\nII\n\n3\n* This suit grew out of a confrontation between petitioner, Muhammad, an inmate, and the respondent Michigan prison official, Close. App. 70. According to his amended complaint, Muhammad was eating breakfast when he saw Close \"staring at him through the hallway window.\" Id., at 71. Eventually Muhammad stared back, provoking Close to assume \"a fighting stance\" and \"com[e] into the dining area at a fast pace with his face contorted.\" Ibid. Muhammad stood up and faced him, and when the two were within a foot of one another, Close asked, \"whats [sic] up,\" all the while \"staring angerly [sic].\" In the aftermath of the confrontation, Muhammad was handcuffed, taken to a detention cell, and charged with violating the prison rule prohibiting \"Threatening Behavior.\" (Emphasis deleted.)3 Under the rules, special detention was required prior to a hearing on the charge, which occurred six days later. Muhammad was acquitted of threatening behavior, but found guilty of the lesser infraction of insolence, for which prehearing detention would not have been mandatory.4 Ibid. Muhammad was required to serve an additional 7 days of detention and deprived of privileges for 30 days as penalties for insolence. Ibid.\n\n\n4\nMuhammad then brought this § 1983 action, alleging that Close had charged him with threatening behavior (and subjected him to mandatory prehearing lockup) in retaliation for prior lawsuits and grievance proceedings against Close. Id., at 72. He amended his original complaint after obtaining counsel, and neither in his amended complaint nor at any subsequent juncture did Muhammad challenge his conviction for insolence, or the subsequent disciplinary action. See Brief for Petitioner 42. The amended complaint sought no expungement of the misconduct finding, and in fact Muhammad conceded that the insolence determination was justified. The only relief sought was $10,000 in compensatory and punitive damages \"for the physical, mental and emotional injuries sustained\" during the six days of prehearing detention mandated by the charge of threatening behavior attributable to Close's retaliatory motive. App. 72.\n\n\n5\nFollowing discovery, the Magistrate Judge recommended summary judgment for Close on the ground that Muhammad had failed to come forward with sufficient evidence of retaliation to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to that element. Id., at 63. The District Court adopted the recommendation. Id., at 70.\n\nB\n\n6\nMuhammad then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which, by an opinion designated not for publication, affirmed the summary judgment for Close, though not on the basis recommended by the Magistrate Judge and adopted by the District Court. 47 Fed. Appx. 738 (2002). Instead of considering the conclusion that Muhammad had produced inadequate evidence of retaliation, a ground that would have been dispositive if sustained, the Court of Appeals held the action barred by Heck because Muhammad had sought, among other relief, the expungement of the misconduct charge from the prison record. Relying upon Circuit precedent, see Huey v. Stine, 230 F. 3d 226 (2000), the Court of Appeals held that an action under § 1983 to expunge his misconduct charge and for other relief occasioned by the misconduct proceedings could be brought only after satisfying Heck's favorable termination requirement. The Circuit thus maintained a split on the applicability of Heck to prison disciplinary proceedings in the absence of any implication going to the fact or duration of underlying sentence, four Circuits having taken the contrary view. See Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F. 3d 532, 542-544 (CA3 2002); DeWalt v. Carter, 224 F. 3d 607, 613 (CA7 2000); Jenkins v. Haubert, 179 F. 3d 19, 27 (CA2 1999); Brown v. Plaut, 131 F. 3d 163, 167-169 (CADC 1997). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 539 U. S. 925 (2003), and now reverse.\n\nIII\n\n7\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals was flawed as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. Its factual error was the assumption that Muhammad sought to expunge the misconduct charge from his prison record. The court simply overlooked the amended complaint that sought no such relief.\n\n\n8\nThe factual error was compounded by following the mistaken view expressed in Circuit precedent that Heck applies categorically to all suits challenging prison disciplinary proceedings. But these administrative determinations do not as such raise any implication about the validity of the underlying conviction, and although they may affect the duration of time to be served (by bearing on the award or revocation of good-time credits) that is not necessarily so. The effect of disciplinary proceedings on good-time credits is a matter of state law or regulation, and in this case, the Magistrate Judge expressly found or assumed that no good-time credits were eliminated by the prehearing action Muhammad called in question. His § 1983 suit challenging this action could not therefore be construed as seeking a judgment at odds with his conviction or with the State's calculation of time to be served in accordance with the underlying sentence. That is, he raised no claim on which habeas relief could have been granted on any recognized theory, with the consequence that Heck's favorable termination requirement was inapplicable.\n\nIV\n\n9\nClose tries to salvage the appellate court's judgment by arguing for the first time here that Heck is squarely on point because, if the § 1983 suit succeeded, Muhammad would be entitled to restoration of some good-time credits with the result of less time to be spent in prison. Brief for Respondent 17-18. But this eleventh-hour contention was waived. The Magistrate Judge's report stated that good-time credits were not affected by the allegedly retaliatory overcharge of threatening behavior and the consequential prehearing detention Muhammad complained of, and Close had every opportunity to challenge the Magistrate Judge's position in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals. Having failed to raise the claim when its legal and factual premises could have been litigated, Close cannot raise it now. See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 464 (1997).\n\n\n10\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed, and the case is remanded for consideration of summary judgment on the ground adopted by the District Court, and for any further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n11\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Alphonse A. Gerhardstein filed a brief for the Prison Reform Advocacy Center as amicus curiae urging reversal.\n\n\n1\n The assumption is that the incarceration that matters underHeck is the incarceration ordered by the original judgment of conviction, not special disciplinary confinement for infraction of prison rules. This Court has never followed the speculation in Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 499 (1973), that such a prisoner subject to \"additional and unconstitutional restraints\" might have a habeas claim independent of § 1983, and the contention is not raised by the State here.\n\n\n2\n Members of the Court have expressed the view that unavailability of habeas for other reasons may also dispense with theHeck requirement. See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 491 (1994) (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment); Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 21-22 (1998) (GINSBURG, J., concurring). This case is no occasion to settle the issue.\n\n\n3\n The Michigan Department of Corrections Policy Directive, No. 03.03.105 (June 6, 1994) (Directive), defines \"Threatening Behavior\" as \"Words, actions or other behavior which expresses a[n] intent to injure or physically abuse another person.\" App. 40 (emphasis deleted)\n\n\n4\n The Directive defines \"Insolence\" as \"Words, actions, or other behavior which is intended to harass, or cause alarm in an employee.\"Id., at 44 (emphasis deleted).\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

WILLIAMSNo. A-828On application to vacate stay of execution\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nApril 9, 1996\n\nPer Curiam.\n\n\n1\nDoyle J. Williams is scheduled to be executed by the State of Missouri on April 10, 1996.  On January 11, 1996, a Federal District  Court denied Williams' third federal habeas corpus petition, finding all  of Williams' claims to be abusive, successive, or procedurally  defaulted.  On March 8, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the  Eighth Circuit entered a summary order staying Williams' execution.  The  Court of Appeals scheduled oral argument for May 13, 1996, and resolved  that the stay would remain in effect pending submission of the case and that Court's further order.  The summary order gives no explanation for  the Court of Appeals' conclusion that oral argument is necessary or that  entry of a stay was appropriate. The Court of Appeals denied a petition  for rehearing en banc, and we now have before us an application to  vacate the stay.\n\n\n2\n\"A stay of execution pending disposition of a second or successive federal habeas petition should be granted only when there are  `substantial grounds upon which relief might be granted.'\"  Delo v.  Stokes, 495 U. S. 320, 321 (1990) (per curiam) (quoting Barefoot v.  Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 895 (1983)). Entry of a stay on a second or  third habeas petition is a drastic measure, and we have held that it is  \"`particularly egregious'\" to enter a stay absent substantial grounds  for relief.  Delo v. Blair, 509 U. S. 823 (1993) (citation omitted).  On  the record before us, we can discern no such grounds.  We are persuaded  by the report prepared by Magistrate Judge Hays, which meticulously addresses each of Williams' claims and finds each to be abusive, successive, procedurally defaulted, or meritless, and by the District  Court's order adopting that report, in which the District Court also  denied Williams' dilatory motion to amend the habeas petition.  The  Court of Appeals abused its discretion by entering a stay on this  record.\n\n\n3\nTo the extent the Court of Appeals discerned substantial grounds  for relief, it failed to reveal them in its summary order granting the  stay. Although we hesitate to say that a Court of Appeals must, in every  case, explain the basis for its entry of a stay, we see fit to remind  the lower courts that entry of a stay without explanation is disfavored.  Cf. Netherland v. Tuggle, 515 U. S. ___ (1995) (per curiam).  When a  court of appeals fails to articulate its reasons for granting a stay, we  lose the benefit of that court's views and must resort to other portions  of the record in evaluating whether to vacate the stay.  In this case, the District Court's careful treatment of Williams' claims and the surface implausibility of those claims persuade us that the stay should  not have been granted, and the Court of Appeals' summary order does not  convince us otherwise.\n\n\n4\nAccordingly, the application to vacate the stay of execution is  granted.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n6\nJustice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and  Justice Breyer join, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nI would deny the application to vacate the stay of Williams' execution.  A diligent appellate court has granted a certificate of  probable cause and scheduled this case for argument on May 13. Those  actions signal to me the existence of reasons, not the absence of  reasons, for granting a stay.  At the very least, before acting  irretrievably, this Court might have invited prompt clarification of the  Court of Appeals' order.  Appreciation of our own fallibility, and  respect for the judgment of an appellate tribunal closer to the scene  than we are, as I see it, demand as much.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 13–113.   Decided December 2, 2013\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   When a taxpayer overpays his taxes, he is generally\nentitled to interest from the Government for the period\nbetween the payment and the ultimate refund. See 26\nU.S. C. §6611(a). That interest begins to run “from the\ndate of overpayment.” §§6611(b)(1), (b)(2). But the Code\ndoes not define “the date of overpayment.”\n   In this case, after the Internal Revenue Service advised\nFord Motor Company that it had underpaid its taxes from\n1983 until 1989, Ford remitted a series of deposits to the\nIRS totaling $875 million. Those deposits stopped the ac-\ncrual of interest that Ford would otherwise owe once the\naudits were completed and the amount of its underpay-\nment was finally determined. See §6601; Rev. Proc. 84–\n58, 1984–2 Cum. Bull. 501. Later, Ford requested that the\nIRS treat the deposits as advance payments of the addi-\ntional tax that Ford owed. Eventually the parties deter-\nmined that Ford had overpaid its taxes in the relevant\nyears, thereby entitling Ford to a return of the over-\npayment as well as interest. But the parties disagreed\nabout when the interest began to run under 26 U.S. C.\n§6611(b)(1). Ford argued that “the date of overpayment”\nwas the date that it first remitted the deposits to the IRS.\nIbid. The Government countered that the date of over-\npayment was the date that Ford requested that the IRS\ntreat the remittances as payments of tax. The difference\nbetween the parties’ competing interpretations of §6611(b)\nis worth some $445 million.\n   Ford sued the Government in Federal District Court,\n2            FORD MOTOR CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nasserting jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C. §1346(a)(1). The\nGovernment did not contest the court’s jurisdiction. See\nBrief in Opposition 3, n. 3. The District Court accepted\nthe Government’s construction of §6611(b) and granted its\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings. A panel of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding\nthat §6611 is a waiver of sovereign immunity that must be\nconstrued strictly in favor of the Government. 508 Fed.\nAppx. 506 (2012).\n   Ford sought certiorari, arguing that the Sixth Circuit\nwas wrong to give §6611 a strict construction. In Ford’s\nview, it is 28 U.S. C. §1346—not §6611—that waives the\nGovernment’s immunity from this suit, and §6611(b) is a\nsubstantive provision that should not be construed strictly.\nSee Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U.S. 474, 491 (2008);\nUnited States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S.\n465, 472–473 (2003). In its response to Ford’s petition for\ncertiorari, however, the Government contended for the\nfirst time that §1346(a)(1) does not apply at all to this suit;\nit argues that the only basis for jurisdiction, and “the only\ngeneral waiver of sovereign immunity that encompasses\n[Ford’s] claim,” is the Tucker Act, 28 U.S. C. §1491(a).\nBrief in Opposition 3, n. 3. Although the Government\nacquiesced in jurisdiction in the lower courts, if the Gov-\nernment is now correct that the Tucker Act applies to this\nsuit, jurisdiction over this case was proper only in the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims. See §1491(a).\n   This Court “is one of final review, ‘not of first view.’ ”\nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 529\n(2009) (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718,\nn. 7 (2005)). The Sixth Circuit should have the first oppor-\ntunity to consider the Government’s new contention with\nrespect to jurisdiction in this case.

The hearing was held 27 days after the car was towed and his claim was denied. He then filed a 42 U. S. C. § 1983 suit, claiming that the city violated his due process rights by failing to provide a sufficiently prompt hearing. The District Court granted the city summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the Constitution required the city to provide an earlier hearing, perhaps within 48 hours of towing and at least within 5 days.\nHeld: The Due Process Clause does not prohibit an agency from imposing the kind of procedural delay experienced here when holding hearings to consider claims such as David's. The three factors that normally determine whether an individual has received the \"process\" that the Constitution finds \"due\" — which were set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335, and applied in FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U. S. 230, 242 — require reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision. The first factor — the \"private interest\" affected by the official action — is a monetary interest that does not work the far more serious harm caused by the temporary deprivation of a job that was at issue in Mallen. The second factor — concern for accuracy — also does not support the Ninth Circuit's conclusion. A 30-day delay in presenting evidence is unlikely to spawn significant factual errors, and the nature of the issue — whether a car is illegally parked — indicates that initial towing errors are unlikely. The third factor — the government's interest — argues strongly in the city's favor. Only five percent of the 1,000 impound hearings the city holds annually are conducted within 48 hours, and those involve persons who cannot afford the impoundment fees. The delay is substantially required by administrative needs related to organizing the hearing, e. g., arranging for the towing officer to appear. Requiring the city to hold 1,000 hearings, rather than 50, within a short time period would prove burdensome.\nCertiorari granted; 307 F. 3d 1143, reversed.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nOn August 13, 1998, an officer of the city of Los Angeles Department of Transportation ordered respondent Edwin David's automobile towed from a spot where parking was forbidden. After paying $134.50, David recovered his car. David, believing that the trees obstructed his view of the \"no parking\" sign, requested a hearing to recover the money. On September 9, 1998 — 27 days after the vehicle was towed — the city held the hearing and denied David's claim.\n\n\n2\nDavid then brought this lawsuit in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, arguing that the city, in failing to provide a sufficiently prompt hearing, had violated his federal right to \"due process of law.\" Amdt. 14, § 1. The District Court granted summary judgment for the city. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a vote of 2 to 1, reversed, holding that the Constitution required the city to provide an earlier payment-recovery hearing, perhaps within 48 hours of the towing and at least within 5 days. 307 F. 3d 1143, 1147 (2002). The city, seeking certiorari here, argues that the Ninth Circuit's holding runs contrary to well-settled principles of constitutional law. We agree. We grant the writ and summarily reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment.\n\n\n3\nIn Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976), the Court set forth three factors that normally determine whether an individual has received the \"process\" that the Constitution finds \"due\":\n\n\n4\n\"First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\" By weighing these concerns, courts can determine whether a State has met the \"fundamental requirement of due process\" — \"the opportunity to be heard `at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'\" Id., at 333.\n\n\n5\nIn FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U. S. 230, 242 (1988), the Court considered circumstances in which \"impairment of an individual's property is not preceded by any opportunity for a pre-deprivation hearing.\" A Government agency had suspended an indicted bank employee from his job. A statute required the agency to provide a postdeprivation hearing within 30 days and to issue a decision within 60 days of that hearing. The bank employee claimed that the 30- or 90-day delay between (a) the suspension and (b) the postsuspension hearing and decision violated the Due Process Clause. The Court recognized that there \"is a point at which an unjustified delay in completing a post-deprivation proceeding `would become a constitutional violation.'\" Ibid. It applied Eldridge-type factors to determine whether that point had been reached. 486 U. S., at 242 (assessing the importance of, and harm to, the private interest, the likelihood of interim error, and the governmental interest in a delay). And it concluded that a 30-day delay of the hearing, and a potential 90-day delay of a decision, did not violate the Constitution. Id., at 243.\n\n\n6\nEldridge, as applied in Mallen, requires reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision. The first Eldridge factor, the \"private interest,\" is a monetary interest here. It consists of the private individual's interest in maintaining the use of money between (a) the time of paying the impoundment and towing fees and (b) the time of the hearing. The temporary deprivation of a job, the \"private interest\" at issue in Mallen, typically works a far more serious harm. Cf. Eldridge, supra, at 340 (distinguishing in this respect between benefits \"not based upon financial need\" and welfare assistance \"given to persons on the very margin of subsistence\"). So does a temporary deprivation of the use of the automobile itself — the relevant deprivation at issue in the lower court cases to which the Ninth Circuit looked for support. See Stypmann v. San Francisco, 557 F. 2d 1338, 1342-1344 (CA9 1977). Cf. Goichman v. Rheuban Motors, Inc., 682 F. 2d 1320, 1324 (CA9 1982). Indeed, the city indicates that any loss in the time value of the money can be compensated by an interest payment. Pet. for Cert. 7.\n\n\n7\nThe second Eldridge factor — concern for accuracy — does not support the Ninth Circuit's conclusion. A 30-day delay in presenting evidence is unlikely to spawn significant factual errors. Administrative and judicial proceedings normally take place after considerably more time has elapsed. And the straightforward nature of the issue — whether the car was illegally parked — indicates that initial towing errors, while they may occur, are unlikely. Cf. Mallen, supra, at 244-245 (finding \"little likelihood that the deprivation is without basis\" in light of the grand jury indictment).\n\n\n8\nThe third Eldridge factor — the \"Government's interest\" — argues strongly in the city's favor. The nature of the city's interest in delay is one of administrative necessity. The city points out that it \"conducts more than a thousand vehicle impound hearings annually.\" Pet. for Cert. 8. It holds about five percent of these hearings — those involving individuals who are unable to afford the impoundment fees — within 48 hours. Ibid. It \"takes time to organize hearings: there are only so many courtrooms and presiding officials; the city has to contact the towing officer and arrange for his appearance; the city may have to find a substitute to cover that officer's responsibilities while he attends the hearing.\" 307 F. 3d, at 1149 (Kozinski, J., dissenting). And the Ninth Circuit's holding, which presumably would require the city to schedule annually 1,000 or more hearings, instead of 50 hearings, within a 48-hour (or 5-day) time limit, will prove burdensome. The administrative resources available to modern police departments are not limitless. The administrative necessity supporting the delay here is no less substantial than the governmental interest in the 30-day hearing delay in Mallen, namely, the need to protect the integrity of the banking system and to prepare thoroughly for the hearing. Mallen, supra, at 244. We also add that the reason for denying a predeprivation hearing here — such a hearing is impossible if the city is to be able to enforce the parking rules — is not any less important than in Mallen.\n\n\n9\nWe conclude that the 27-day delay in holding a hearing here reflects no more than a routine delay substantially required by administrative needs. Our cases make clear that the Due Process Clause does not prohibit an agency from imposing this kind of procedural delay when holding hearings to consider claims of the kind here at issue. The Ninth Circuit's judgment to the contrary is reversed.\n\n\n10\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

The question raised is whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U.S. C. §1602 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. III), forbids that attachment.\nThe judgment for money damages consists of a default judgment against the Islamic Republic of Iran (for about $300 million) that the private citizen, Dariush Elahi, obtained in a federal-court lawsuit claiming that the Republic had murdered his brother. Elahi v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 124 F. Supp. 2d 97, 103 (DC 2000). The asset is an arbitration award (against a third party), which Iran's Ministry of Defense obtained in Switzerland. Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of Islamic Republic of Iran v. Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., 385 F.3d 1206, 1211 (CA9 2004). The Ministry asked the Federal District Court for the Southern District of California to confirm the award. Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of Islamic Republic of Iran v. Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., 236 F. Supp. 2d 1140 (2002). The court did so. And Elahi then intervened, seeking to impose a lien upon the award. The Ministry opposed the attachment on the ground that the Act grants it immunity from such a claim.\nThe Federal District Court rejected the Ministry's immunity defense on the ground that, by suing to enforce the award, the Ministry had waived any such immunity. On appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed with the District Court about waiver. But it then found against the Ministry on a different grounda ground that the parties had not argued. The Act says that under certain conditions the property of an \"agency or instrumentality\" of a foreign government is \"not . . . immune from attachment\" if the agency is \"engaged in commercial activity in the United States.\" 28 U.S. C. §1610(b) (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals found that the Ministry engages in commercial activity and that the other conditions were satisfied. 385 F.3d, at 1219-1222 (applying §1610(b)(2)). And it held that this section of the Act barred the Ministry's assertion of immunity. Ibid.\nThe Ministry filed a petition for certiorari asking us to review that decision. The Solicitor General agrees with the Ministry that we should grant the writ but limited to the Ministry's Question 1, namely whether \"the property of a foreign state stricto sensu, situated in the United States\" is \"immune from attachment . . . as provided in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\" Pet. for Cert. i (citing §§1603(a), 1610(a)). The Solicitor General also asks us to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for consideration of whether the Ministry is simply a \"foreign state\" (what the Ministry calls \"a foreign state stricto sensu\") or whether the Ministry is an \"agency or instrumentality\" of a foreign state (as the Ninth Circuit held). Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15-17. We grant the writ limited to Question 1.\nThe Act, as it applies to the \"property in the United States of a foreign state,\" §1610(a) (emphasis added), does not contain the \"engaged in commercial activity\" exception that the Ninth Circuit described. That exception applies only where the property at issue is property of an \"agency or instrumentality\" of a foreign state. Compare §1610(b) (\"property . . . of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial activity\") with §1610(a) (\"property . . . of a foreign state used for a commercial activity\") (emphasis added). The difference is critical. Moreover, in the Solicitor General's view a defense ministry (unlike, say, a government-owned commercial enterprise) generally is not an \"agency or instrumentality\" of a foreign state but an inseparable part of the state itself. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8-11; see also Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, 30 F.3d 148, 153 (CADC 1994) (\"hold[ing] that armed forces are as a rule so closely bound up with the structure of the state that they must in all cases be considered as the `foreign state' itself, rather than a separate `agency or instrumentality' of the state\").\nWe shall not now determine whether the Solicitor General is correct about the status of the Ministry, for the Ninth Circuit did not address the question nor did the parties argue the matter before the Circuit. Neither can we fault the Ministry for that failure. As we said, supra, at 1, the District Court based its denial of immunity upon waiver. The parties' Ninth Circuit briefs focused on matters not relevant here (such as the waiver question), with one exception. The exception consists of a footnote in Elahi's brief mentioning the Act's \"agency and instrumentality\" provision. That footnote, however, does not ask for affirmance on that basis; nor did it provide the Ministry with clear notice that a reply was necessary. Answering Brief of Appellee in No. 03-55015 (CA9), p. 45, n. 27 (stating that \"[i]f [the Ministry] is considered `an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,' rather than the foreign state itself, Mr. Elahi's attachment still is valid\" (emphasis added)).\nThe Ninth Circuit said that it was free to affirm on \"any ground supported by the record.\" 385 F.3d, at 1219, n. 15. But the court did not explain what in the record might demonstrate that the Ministry is an \"agency or instrumentality\" of the state rather than an integral part of the state itself. The court noted that \"Elahi appears to concede\" that the Ministry is an \"agency and instrumentality,\" id., at 1218, n. 13, but any relevant concession would have to have come from the Ministry, not from Elahi, whose position the concession favors. Thus, in implicitly concluding that the Ministry was an \"agency or instrumentality\" of the Republic of Iran within the meaning of §1610(b), the Ninth Circuit either mistakenly relied on a concession by respondent that could not possibly bind petitioner, or else erroneously presumed that there was no relevant distinction between a foreign state and its agencies or instrumentalities for purposes of that subsection. See §1603(a), (b). Either way, the Ninth Circuit committed error that was essential to its judgment in favor of respondent.\nBecause the Ninth Circuit did not consider, and the Ministry had no reasonable opportunity to argue, the critical legal point we have mentioned, we vacate the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

CORY DONALD\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 14–618.   Decided March 30, 2015\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Federal courts may grant habeas corpus relief if the\nunderlying state-court decision was “contrary to, or in­\nvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by” this Court. 28 U.S. C.\n§2254(d)(1). Here, the Sixth Circuit held that respondent\nCory Donald’s attorney provided per se ineffective assis­\ntance of counsel under United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S.\n648 (1984), when he was briefly absent during testimony\nconcerning other defendants. Because no decision from\nthis Court clearly establishes that Donald is entitled to\nrelief under Cronic, we reverse.\n                             I\n  After a day of drinking and smoking marijuana, Cory\nDonald and four others—Seante Liggins, Rashad Moore,\nDewayne Saine, and Fawzi Zaya—decided to rob a drug\ndealer named Mohammed Makki. Donald, Moore, and\nLiggins drove to Makki’s home in Dearborn, Michigan,\nwearing black skull caps and coats. Moore and Donald\nentered the house, while Liggins waited in the car.\n  Michael McGinnis, one of Makki’s drug runners, was in\nthe house at the time. When Donald and Moore came\nthrough the door, McGinnis raised his hands and dropped\nface-down to the floor. He heard a scuffle in the kitchen\nand two gunshots as someone said, “ ‘[L]et it go.’ ” Donald\nv. Rapelje, 580 Fed. Appx. 277, 279 (CA6 2014). After\nthat, McGinnnis felt a gun on the back of his head while\nsomeone rifled through his pockets saying, “ ‘[W]hat you\n2                    WOODS v. DONALD\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ngot, what you got?’ ” Donald v. Rapelje, 2012 WL 6047130,\n*3 (ED Mich., Dec. 5, 2012). He also heard one of the two\nmen whisper to the other, “ ‘I got shot, I got shot.’ ” 580\nFed. Appx., at 279. After Moore and Donald left, McGin­\nnis found Makki slumped against the refrigerator dying.\n   About seven minutes after they entered the house,\nMoore and Donald returned, guns in hand, to Liggins’ car.\nDonald told the others that he had stolen $320 and that\nMoore had accidentally shot him during the crime. That\nnight, Donald checked into a hospital for a gunshot wound\nto his foot. Police arrested him about three weeks later.\n   The State charged Donald with one count of first-degree\nfelony murder and two counts of armed robbery. Liggins\nand Zaya pleaded guilty, and Donald was tried with Moore\nand Saine. His defense theory was that he was present at\nthe scene of the crime but he did not participate. At trial,\nthe government sought to admit a chart chronicling phone\ncalls from the day of the crime among Moore, Saine, and\nZaya. Moore and Saine’s attorneys objected, but Donald’s\nattorney declined, saying: “ ‘I don’t have a dog in this race.\nIt does not affect me at all.’ ” Id., at 280. The court admit­\nted the exhibit and took a short recess.\n   When the trial resumed, Donald’s counsel was not in the\ncourtroom. At first, the judge indicated that he would\nwait for the attorney. But he then decided to proceed\nbecause Donald’s counsel had already indicated that the\nexhibit and testimony did not apply to his client. About 10\nminutes later, the lawyer returned. The judge informed\nhim that “ ‘up until that point we only were discussing the\ntelephone chart,’ ” to which the attorney replied, “ ‘[ Y ]es,\nyour Honor, and as I had indicated on the record, I had no\ndog in the race and no interest in that.’ ” Ibid.\n   The jury found Donald guilty on all three counts. He\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment for the felony-murder\ncount and to concurrent prison terms of 10½ to 20 years\nfor each of the armed robbery counts. On appeal, Donald\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nargued that he was entitled to a new trial because his\nattorney’s absence during the phone call testimony denied\nhim his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected his\nclaim, and the Michigan Supreme Court denied review.\n   The United States District Court for the Eastern Dis­\ntrict of Michigan granted federal habeas relief, and the\nSixth Circuit affirmed. The Sixth Circuit held that the\nMichigan Court of Appeals’ decision was both contrary to\nand involved an unreasonable application of this Court’s\ndecision in Cronic. In the normal course, defendants\nclaiming ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the\nfamiliar framework of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n668, 687 (1984), which requires a showing that “counsel’s\nperformance was deficient” and “that the deficient perfor­\nmance prejudiced the defense.” And when reviewing an\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, “a court must\nindulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls\nwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assis­\ntance.” Id., at 689.\n   In Cronic, however, we held that courts may presume\nthat a defendant has suffered unconstitutional prejudice if\nhe “is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.” 466\nU.S., at 659. And in Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 696\n(2002), we characterized a “critical stage” as one that “held\nsignificant consequences for the accused.” According to\nthe Sixth Circuit, these statements should have compelled\nthe Michigan court to hold that the phone call testimony\nwas a “critical stage” and that counsel’s absence consti­\ntuted per se ineffective assistance. Without identifying any\ndecision from this Court directly in point, the Sixth Circuit\nconcluded that the relevant testimony in this case was\n“similar to” our cases applying Cronic. 580 Fed. Appx., at\n284.\n4                     WOODS v. DONALD\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n                                 II\n\n                                 A\n\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a federal court may\ngrant habeas relief only when a state court’s decision on\nthe merits was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as deter­\nmined by” decisions from this Court, or was “based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts.” 28 U.S. C.\n§2254(d). Donald does not argue that the state-court\ndecision in his case was factually erroneous. Instead, he\nargues that the decision was both contrary to and involved\nan unreasonable application of this Court’s ineffective-\nassistance-of-counsel cases.\n   AEDPA’s standard is intentionally “ ‘ “difficult to\nmeet.” ’ ” White v. Woodall, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip\nop., at 3) (quoting Metrish v. Lancaster, 569 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 5)). We have explained that “ ‘clearly\nestablished Federal law’ for purposes of §2254(d)(1) in­\ncludes only the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt’s decisions.” White, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted). “And an ‘unrea­\nsonable application of ’ those holdings must be objectively\nunreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear error will not\nsuffice.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3–4) (same). To satisfy this\nhigh bar, a habeas petitioner is required to “show that the\nstate court’s ruling on the claim being presented in federal\ncourt was so lacking in justification that there was an\nerror well understood and comprehended in existing law\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 83, 103 (2011).\n   Adherence to these principles serves important interests\nof federalism and comity. AEDPA’s requirements reflect a\n“presumption that state courts know and follow the law.”\nWoodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24 (2002) ( per curiam).\nWhen reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nreview, federal judges are required to afford state courts\ndue respect by overturning their decisions only when there\ncould be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong.\nFederal habeas review thus exists as “a guard against\nextreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice sys­\ntems, not a substitute for ordinary error correction\nthrough appeal.” Harrington, supra, at 102–103 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This is especially true for\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel, where AEDPA\nreview must be “ ‘ “doubly deferential” ’ ” in order to afford\n“both the state court and the defense attorney the benefit\nof the doubt.” Burt v. Titlow, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 1) (quoting Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 17)).\n                              B\n   The Sixth Circuit should not have affirmed the Cronic­\nbased grant of habeas relief in this case. The Michigan\nCourt of Appeals’ decision was not contrary to any clearly\nestablished holding of this Court. We have never ad­\ndressed whether the rule announced in Cronic applies to\ntestimony regarding codefendants’ actions. In Cronic\nitself, we rejected the defendant’s claim that his counsel’s\nlack of experience and short time for preparation warranted\na presumption of prejudice, not a claim based on coun-\nsel’s absence. See 466 U.S., at 663–666. When announc­\ning the rule in Cronic, we cited earlier cases finding\nprejudice where “counsel was either totally absent, or\nprevented from assisting the accused during a critical\nstage of the proceeding.” Id., at 659, n. 25. But none of\nthose cases dealt with circumstances like those present\nhere. And Bell did not involve the absence of counsel;\ninstead, we declined to presume prejudice where a capital\ndefendant’s counsel “failed to ‘mount some case for life’\nafter the prosecution introduced evidence in the sentenc­\ning hearing and gave a closing statement.” 535 U.S., at\n6                     WOODS v. DONALD\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n696.\n   Because none of our cases confront “the specific question\npresented by this case,” the state court’s decision could not\nbe “contrary to” any holding from this Court. Lopez v.\nSmith, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at\n5). The most that the Sixth Circuit could muster was that\n“[t]he testimony of a government witness is similar to the\ntrial events that th[is] Court has deemed to be critical\nstages.” 580 Fed. Appx., at 284. But that conclusion is\ndoubly wrong. First, if the circumstances of a case are\nonly “similar to” our precedents, then the state court’s\ndecision is not “contrary to” the holdings in those cases.\nSee, e.g., Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70, 76–77, and n. 2\n(2006). Second, the Sixth Circuit framed the issue at too\nhigh a level of generality. See, e.g., Lopez, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 5). The relevant testimony was not merely\n“testimony of a government witness”; it was prosecution\ntestimony about other defendants. To be sure, the Sixth\nCircuit considered the testimony relevant to Donald be­\ncause he was being prosecuted on an aiding-and-abetting\ntheory for felony murder. But Donald’s position was that\nhe had nothing to do with the planning among his code­\nfendants. And none of our holdings address counsel’s\nabsence during testimony that is irrelevant within the\ndefendant’s own theory of the case.\n   Nor was the state court’s decision an unreasonable\napplication of our cases. The Sixth Circuit stated “that a\ncritical stage of trial is a ‘step of a criminal proceeding . . .\nthat h[olds] significant consequences for the accused.’ ”\n580 Fed. Appx., at 284 (quoting Bell, supra, at 696). And\nit held that the Michigan Court of Appeals’ decision was\n“objectively unreasonable” because the phone call evidence\nmight have indirectly inculpated Donald in the eyes of the\njury. But that holding is not correct. Just last Term we\nwarned the Sixth Circuit that “where the ‘ “precise con­\ntours” ’ of [a] right remain ‘ “unclear,” ’ state courts enjoy\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)                  7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n‘broad discretion’ in their adjudication of a prisoner’s\nclaims.” White, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting\nLockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 76 (2003), in turn quot­\ning Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 998 (1991)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and in judgment)).\nWithin the contours of Cronic, a fairminded jurist could\nconclude that a presumption of prejudice is not warranted\nby counsel’s short absence during testimony about other\ndefendants where that testimony was irrelevant to the\ndefendant’s theory of the case.\n   Cronic applies in “circumstances that are so likely to\nprejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect\nin a particular case is unjustified.” 466 U.S., at 658. The\nMichigan Court of Appeals’ refusal to apply it to these\ncircumstances was not the “extreme malfunction” required\nfor federal habeas relief. Harrington, 562 U.S., at 102.\n                             III\n   Because we consider this case only in the narrow con­\ntext of federal habeas review, we “expres[s] no view on the\nmerits of the underlying Sixth Amendment principle.”\nMarshall v. Rodgers, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) ( per curiam)\n(slip op., at 7). All that matters here, and all that should\nhave mattered to the Sixth Circuit, is that we have not\nheld that Cronic applies to the circumstances presented in\nthis case. For that reason, federal habeas relief based\nupon Cronic is unavailable.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

SCALIA, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nO'CONNOR, delivered the opinion of the Court.\nWe consider whether the United States may offset Social Security benefits to collect a student loan debt that has been outstanding for over 10 years.\n\nI\n\nA\nPetitioner James Lockhart failed to repay federally reinsured student loans that he had incurred between 1984 and 1989 under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. These loans were eventually reassigned to the Department of Education, which certified the debt to the Department of the Treasury through the Treasury Offset Program. In 2002, the Government began withholding a portion of petitioner's Social Security payments to offset his debt, some of which was more than 10 years delinquent.\nPetitioner sued in Federal District Court, alleging that under the Debt Collection Act's 10-year statute of limitations, the offset was time barred. The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 376 F.3d 1027 (2004). We granted certiorari, 544 U.

Paige, 376 F.3d 1179 (CA8 2004), and now affirm.\n\nB\nThe Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, provides that, after pursuing the debt collection channels set out in 31 U.S. C. §3711(a), an agency head can collect an outstanding debt \"by administrative offset.\" §3716(a). The availability of offsets against Social Security benefits is limited, as the Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, as amended, makes Social Security benefits, in general, not \"subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.\" 42 U.S. C. §407(a). The Social Security Act purports to protect this anti-attachment rule with an express-reference provision: \"No other provision of law, enacted before, on, or after April 20, 1983, may be construed to limit, supersede, or otherwise modify the provisions of this section except to the extent that it does so by express reference to this section.\" §407(b).\nMoreover, the Debt Collection Act's offset provisions generally do not authorize the collection of claims which, like petitioner's debts at issue here, are over 10 years old. 31 U.S. C. §3716(e)(1). In 1991, however, the Higher Education Technical Amendments, 105 Stat. 123, sweepingly eliminated time limitations as to certain loans: \"Notwithstanding any other provision of statute . . . no limitation shall terminate the period within which suit may be filed, a judgment may be enforced, or an offset, garnishment, or other action initiated or taken,\" 20 U.S. C. §1091a(a)(2), for the repayment of various student loans, including the loans at issue here, §1091a(a)(2)(D).\nThe Higher Education Technical Amendments, by their terms, did not make Social Security benefits subject to offset; these were still protected by the Social Security Act's anti-attachment rule. Only in 1996 did the Debt Collection Improvement Actin amending and recodifying the Debt Collection Actprovide that, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law (including [§407] . . . ),\" with a limited exception not relevant here, \"all payment due an individual under . . . the Social Security Act . . . shall be subject to offset under this section.\" 31 U.S. C. §3716(c)(3)(A)(i).\n\nII\nThe Government does not contend that the \"notwithstanding\" clauses in both the Higher Education Technical Amendments and the Debt Collection Improvement Act trump the Social Security Act's express-reference provision. Cf. Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 310 (1955) (\"Exemptions from the terms of the . . . Act are not lightly to be presumed in view of the statement . . . that modifications must be express[.] But . . . [u]nless we are to require the Congress to employ magical passwords in order to effectuate an exemption from the . . . Act, we must hold that the present statute expressly supersedes the . . . provisions of that Act\" (citation omitted)); Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U.S. 452, 465 (1908).\nWe need not decide the effect of express-reference provisions such as §407(b) to resolve this case. Because the Debt Collection Improvement Act clearly makes Social Security benefits subject to offset, it provides exactly the sort of express reference that the Social Security Act says is necessary to supersede the anti-attachment provision.\nIt is clear that the Higher Education Technical Amendments remove the 10-year limit that would otherwise bar offsetting petitioner's Social Security benefits to pay off his student loan debt. Petitioner argues that Congress could not have intended in 1991 to repeal the Debt Collection Act's statute of limitations as to offsets against Social Security benefitssince debt collection by Social Security offset was not authorized until five years later. Therefore, petitioner continues, the Higher Education Technical Amendments' abrogation of time limits in 1991 only applies to then-valid means of debt collection. We disagree. \"The fact that Congress may not have foreseen all of the consequences of a statutory enactment is not a sufficient reason for refusing to give effect to its plain meaning.\" Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U.S. 151, 158 (1991).\nPetitioner points out that the Higher Education Technical Amendments, unlike the Debt Collection Improvement Act, do not explicitly mention §407. But §407(b) only requires an express reference to authorize attachment in the first placewhich the Debt Collection Improvement Act has already provided.\n\nIII\nNor does the Debt Collection Improvement Act's 1996 recodification of the Debt Collection Act help petitioner. The Debt Collection Improvement Act, in addition to adding offset authority against Social Security benefits, retained the Debt Collection Act's general 10-year bar on offset authority. But the mere retention of this previously enacted time bar does not make the time bar apply in all contextsa result that would extend far beyond Social Security benefits, since it would imply that the Higher Education Technical Amendments' abrogation of time limits was now a dead letter as to any kind of administrative offset. Rather, the Higher Education Technical Amendments retain their effect as a limited exception to the Debt Collection Act time bar in the student loan context.\nFinally, we decline to read any meaning into the failed 2004 effort to amend the Debt Collection Act to explicitly authorize offset of debts over 10 years old. See H. R. 5025, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., §642 (Sept. 8, 2004); S. 2806, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., §642 (Sept. 15, 2004). \"[F]ailed legislative proposals are `a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute.'\" United States v. Craft, 535 U.S. 274, 287 (2002) (quoting Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990)). In any event, it is unclear what meaning we could read into this effort even if we were inclined to do so, as the failed amendmentwhich was not limited to offsets against Social Security benefitswould have had a different effect than the interpretation we advance today.\nTherefore, we affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.\nIt is so ordered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA, concurring.\nI agree with the Court that, even if the express-reference requirement in §207(b) of the Social Security Act is binding, it has been met here; and I join the opinion of the Court, because it does not imply that the requirement is binding. I would go further, however, and say that it is not.\n\"[O]ne legislature,\" Chief Justice Marshall wrote, \"cannot abridge the powers of a succeeding legislature.\" Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 135 (1810). \"The correctness of this principle, so far as respects general legislation,\" he asserted, \"can never be controverted.\" Ibid. See also Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (unlike the Constitution, a legislative Act is \"alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it\"); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 90 (1765) (\"Acts of parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent parliaments bind not\"); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 125-126 (1868) (reprint 1987). Our cases have uniformly endorsed this principle. See, e.g., United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839, 872 (1996) (plurality opinion); Reichelderfer v. Quinn, 287 U.S. 315, 318 (1932) (\"[T]he will of a particular Congress . . . does not impose itself upon those to follow in succeeding years\"); Manigault v. Springs, 199 U.S. 473, 487 (1905); Newton v. Commissioners, 100 U.S. 548, 559 (1880) (in cases involving \"public interests\" and \"public laws,\" \"there can be . . . no irrepealable law\"); see generally 1 L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law §2-3, p. 125, n. 1 (3d ed. 2000).\nAmong the powers of a legislature that a prior legislature cannot abridge is, of course, the power to make its will known in whatever fashion it deems appropriate including the repeal of pre-existing provisions by simply and clearly contradicting them. Thus, in Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302 (1955), we interpreted the Immigration and Nationality Act as impliedly exempting deportation hearings from the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), despite the requirement in §12 of the APA that \"[n]o subsequent legislation shall be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act except to the extent that such legislation shall do so expressly,\" 60 Stat. 244. The Court refused \"to require the Congress to employ magical passwords in order to effectuate an exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act.\" 349 U.S., at 310. We have made clear in other cases as well, that an express-reference or express-statement provision cannot nullify the unambiguous import of a subsequent statute. In Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U.S. 452, 465 (1908), we said of an express-statement requirement that \"[a]s the section . . . in question has only the force of a statute, its provisions cannot justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested either expressly or by necessary implication in a subsequent enactment.\" (Emphasis added.) A subsequent Congress, we have said, may exempt itself from such requirements by \"fair implication\" that is, without an express statement. Warden v. Marrero, 417 U.S. 653, 659-660, n. 10 (1974). See also Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U.S. 205, 218 (1910).\nTo be sure, legislative express-reference or express-statement requirements may function as background canons of interpretation of which Congress is presumptively aware. For example, we have asserted that exemptions from the APA are \"not lightly to be presumed\" in light of its express-reference requirement, Marcello, supra, at 310; see also Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 51 (1955). That assertion may add little or nothing to our already-powerful presumption against implied repeals.\n\"We have repeatedly stated . . . that absent a clearly established congressional intention, repeals by implication are not favored. An implied repeal will only be found where provisions in two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict, or where the latter Act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute.\" Branch v. Smith, 538 U.S. 254, 273 (2003) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nSee also Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S 535, 551 (1974).When the plain import of a later statute directly conflicts with an earlier statute, the later enactment governs, regardless of its compliance with any earlier-enacted requirement of an express reference or other \"magical password.\"\nFor the reasons set forth in the majority opinion, in the Higher Education Technical Amendments and the Debt Collection Improvement Act, Congress unambiguously authorized, without exception, the collection of 10-year-old student-loan debt by administrative offset of Government payments. In doing so, it flatly contradicted, and thereby effectively repealed, part of §207(a) of the Social Security Act. This repeal is effective, regardless of whether the express-reference requirement of §207(b) is fulfilled.\nDespite our jurisprudence on this subject, it is regrettably not uncommon for Congress to attempt to burden the future exercise of legislative power with express-reference and express-statement requirements. See, e.g., 1 U.S. C. §109; 5 U.S. C. §559; 25 U.S. C. §1735(b); 42 U.S. C. §2000bb3(b); 50 U.S. C. §§1547(a)(1), 1621(b). In the present case, it might seem more respectful of Congress to refrain from declaring the invalidity of the express-reference provision. I suppose that would depend upon which Congress one has in mind: the prior one that enacted the provision, or the current one whose clearly expressed legislative intent it is designed to frustrate. In any event, I think it does no favor to the Members of Congress, and to those who assist in drafting their legislation, to keep secret the fact that such express-reference provisions are ineffective.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Clement, Assistant Attorney General Keisler, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, and Barbara L. Herwig.\nAllison M. Zieve argued the cause for respondents. With her on the brief were Brian Wolfman and Scott L. Nelson.\nJUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\nThe authority of the Courts of Appeals to review \"all final decisions of the district courts,\" 28 U.S.C. § 1291, includes appellate jurisdiction over \"a narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation,\" but are sufficiently important and collateral to the merits that they should \"nonetheless be treated as final,\" Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 867 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). The issue here is whether a refusal to apply the judgment bar of the Federal Tort Claims Act is open to collateral appeal. We hold it is not.\n\nI\nThe complaint alleges that Susan Hallock owned a computer software business that she and her husband, Richard, operated from home. After information about Richard Hallock's credit card was stolen and used to pay the subscription fee for a child pornography Web site, agents of the United States Customs Service, investigating the Web site, traced *348 the payment to Richard Hallock's card and got a warrant to search the Hallocks' residence. With that authority, they seized the Hallocks' computer equipment, software, and disk drives. No criminal charges were ever brought, but the Government's actions produced a different disaster. When the computer equipment was returned, several of the disk drives were damaged, all of the stored data (including trade secrets and account files) were lost, and the Hallocks were forced out of business.\nIn July 2002, Susan Hallock and her company brought an action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, invoking the waiver of sovereign immunity, 28 U.S.C. § 1346, and alleging negligence by the customs agents in executing the search. The merits of the claim were never addressed, for the District Court granted the Government's motion to dismiss, holding that the agents' activities occurred in the course of detaining goods and thus fell within an exception to the Act's waiver of sovereign immunity, § 2680(e). Hallock v. United States, 253 F. Supp. 2d 361 (NDNY 2003).\nWhile the suit against the Government was still pending, Susan Hallock filed this action against the individual agents under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), alleging in her complaint that the agents had damaged her computers and thus deprived her of property including business income in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. After the District Court dismissed the first suit against the Government, the agents moved for judgment in the Bivens action, citing the judgment bar of the Tort Claims Act, that \"the judgment in an action under [§] 1346(b) of this title shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\" § 2676.\nThe District Court denied the motion, holding that dismissal of the action against the Government under the Tort *349 Claims Act was solely on a procedural ground, and thus failed to raise the judgment bar. Hallock v. Bonner, 281 F. Supp. 2d 425, 427 (NDNY 2003). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, after first finding jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine. Hallock v. Bonner, 387 F.3d 147 (2004). We granted certiorari to consider the judgment bar, 545 U.S. 1103 (2005), but now vacate for want of appellate jurisdiction on the part of the Court of Appeals.\n\nII\nThe collateral order doctrine, identified with Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949), is \"best understood not as an exception to the `final decision' rule laid down by Congress in § 1291, but as a `practical construction' of it.\" Digital Equipment, supra, at 867 (quoting Cohen, supra, at 546). Whereas 28 U.S.C. § 1291 \"gives courts of appeals jurisdiction over `all final decisions' of district courts\" that are not directly appealable to us, Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 305 (1996), the collateral order doctrine accommodates a \"small class\" of rulings, not concluding the litigation, but conclusively resolving \"claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action,\" ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The claims are \"too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\" Cohen, supra, at 546.\nThe requirements for collateral order appeal have been distilled down to three conditions: that an order \"`[1] conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.'\" Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 144 (1993) (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468 (1978)). The conditions are \"stringent,\" Digital Equipment, supra, *350 at 868 (citing Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989)), and unless they are kept so, the underlying doctrine will overpower the substantial finality interests § 1291 is meant to further: judicial efficiency, for example, and the \"sensible policy `of avoid[ing] the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise.'\" Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 374 (1981) (quoting Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 325 (1940)).\nAccordingly, we have not mentioned applying the collateral order doctrine recently without emphasizing its modest scope. See, e. g., Digital Equipment, 511 U.S., at 868 (\"[T]he `narrow' exception should stay that way and never be allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered ...\" (citation omitted)). And we have meant what we have said; although the Court has been asked many times to expand the \"small class\" of collaterally appealable orders, we have instead kept it narrow and selective in its membership.\n\nA\nPrior cases mark the line between rulings within the class and those outside. On the immediately appealable side are orders rejecting absolute immunity, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 742 (1982), and qualified immunity, Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985). A State has the benefit of the doctrine to appeal a decision denying its claim to Eleventh Amendment immunity, Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, at 144-145, and a criminal defendant may collaterally appeal an adverse ruling on a defense of double jeopardy, Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 660 (1977).\nThe examples admittedly raise the lawyer's temptation to generalize. In each case, the collaterally appealing party was vindicating or claiming a right to avoid trial, in satisfaction of the third condition: unless the order to stand trial was *351 immediately appealable, the right would be effectively lost. Those seeking immediate appeal therefore naturally argue that any order denying a claim of right to prevail without trial satisfies the third condition. But this generalization is too easy to be sound and, if accepted, would leave the final order requirement of § 1291 in tatters. We faced this prospect in Digital Equipment, supra, an appeal from an order rescinding a settlement agreement. Petitioner asserted a \"`right not to stand trial' requiring protection by way of immediate appeal,\" analogizing the rescission to a denial of immunity. Id., at 869. We said no, however, lest \"every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal [be] loosely . . . described as conferring a `right not to stand trial.'\" Id., at 873. Otherwise, \"almost every pretrial or trial order might be called `effectively unreviewable' in the sense that relief from error can never extend to rewriting history.\" Id., at 872.\n\"Allowing immediate appeals to vindicate every such right would move § 1291 aside for claims that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction, that the statute of limitations has run, that the movant has been denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, that an action is barred on claim preclusion principles, that no material fact is in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, or merely that the complaint fails to state a claim. Such motions can be made in virtually every case.\" Id., at 873 (citations omitted).\n\nB\nSince only some orders denying an asserted right to avoid the burdens of trial qualify, then, as orders that cannot be reviewed \"effectively\" after a conventional final judgment, the cases have to be combed for some further characteristic that merits appealability under Cohen; and as Digital Equipment explained, that something further boils down to \"a judgment about the value of the interests that would be *352 lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.\" 511 U.S., at 878-879 (citing Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 524 (1988)). See also Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U.S. 495, 502 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (\"The importance of the right asserted has always been a significant part of our collateral order doctrine\").\nThus, in Nixon, supra, we stressed the \"compelling public ends,\" id., at 758, \"rooted in . . . the separation of powers,\" id., at 749, that would be compromised by failing to allow immediate appeal of a denial of absolute Presidential immunity, id., at 743, 752, n. 32. In explaining collateral order treatment when a qualified immunity claim was at issue in Mitchell, supra, we spoke of the threatened disruption of governmental functions, and fear of inhibiting able people from exercising discretion in public service if a full trial were threatened whenever they acted reasonably in the face of law that is not \"clearly established.\" Id., at 526. Puerto Rico Aqueduct, 506 U.S. 139, explained the immediate appealability of an order denying a claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity by adverting not only to the burdens of litigation but to the need to ensure vindication of a State's dignitary interests. Id., at 146. And although the double jeopardy claim given Cohen treatment in Abney, supra, did not implicate a right to be free of all proceedings whatsoever (since prior jeopardy is essential to the defense), we described the enormous prosecutorial power of the Government to subject an individual \"to embarrassment, expense and ordeal . . . compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety,\" id., at 661-662 (internal quotation marks omitted); the only way to alleviate these consequences of the Government's superior position was by collateral order appeal.\nIn each case, some particular value of a high order was marshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial: honoring the separation of powers, preserving the efficiency of government and the initiative of its officials, respecting a State's dignitary interests, and mitigating the government's *353 advantage over the individual. That is, it is not mere avoidance of a trial, but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest, that counts when asking whether an order is \"effectively\" unreviewable if review is to be left until later. Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S., at 468 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nC\nDoes the claim of the customs agents in this case serve such a weighty public objective that the judgment bar should be treated as an immunity demanding the protection of a collateral order appeal? One can argue, of course, that if the Bivens action goes to trial the efficiency of Government will be compromised and the officials burdened and distracted, as in the qualified immunity case: if qualified immunity gets Cohen treatment, so should the judgment bar to further litigation in the aftermath of the Government's success under the Tort Claims Act. But the cases are different. Qualified immunity is not the law simply to save trouble for the Government and its employees; it is recognized because the burden of trial is unjustified in the face of a colorable claim that the law on point was not clear when the official took action, and the action was reasonable in light of the law as it was. The nub of qualified immunity is the need to induce officials to show reasonable initiative when the relevant law is not \"clearly established,\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982); cf. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2001); a quick resolution of a qualified immunity claim is essential.\nThere is, however, no such public interest at stake simply because the judgment bar is said to be applicable. It is not the preservation of initiative but the avoidance of litigation for its own sake that supports the judgment bar, and if simply abbreviating litigation troublesome to Government employees were important enough for Cohen treatment, collateral order appeal would be a matter of right whenever the Government lost a motion to dismiss under the Tort *354 Claims Act, or a federal officer lost one on a Bivens action, or a state official was in that position in a case under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, or Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). In effect, 28 U.S.C. § 1291 would fade out whenever the Government or an official lost an early round that could have ended the fight.\nAnother difference between qualified immunity and the judgment bar lies in the bar's essential procedural element. While a qualified immunity claim is timely from the moment an official is served with a complaint, the judgment bar can be raised only after a case under the Tort Claims Act has been resolved in the Government's favor. If a Bivens action alone is brought, there will be no possibility of a judgment bar, nor will there be so long as a Bivens action against officials and a Tort Claims Act against the Government are pending simultaneously (as they were for a time here). In the present case, if Susan Hallock had brought her Bivens action and no other, the agents could not possibly have invoked the judgment bar in claiming a right to be free of trial. The closer analogy to the judgment bar, then, is not immunity but the defense of claim preclusion, or res judicata.\nAlthough the statutory judgment bar is arguably broader than traditional res judicata, it functions in much the same way, with both rules depending on a prior judgment as a condition precedent[*] and neither reflecting a policy that a defendant should be scot free of any liability. The concern behind both rules is a different one, of avoiding duplicative litigation, \"multiple suits on identical entitlements or obligations between the same parties.\" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & *355 E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4402, p. 9 (2d ed. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). But this rule of respecting a prior judgment by giving a defense against relitigation has not been thought to protect values so great that only immediate appeal can effectively vindicate them. As we indicated in Digital Equipment, in the usual case, absent particular reasons for discretionary appeal by leave of the trial court, a defense of claim preclusion is fairly subordinated to the general policy of deferring appellate review to the moment of final judgment. 511 U.S., at 873.\nThe judgment bar at issue in this case has no claim to greater importance than the typical defense of claim preclusion; and we hold true to form in deciding what Digital Equipment implied, that an order rejecting the defense of judgment bar under 28 U.S.C. § 2676 cries for no immediate appeal of right as a collateral order.\nWe vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nIt is so ordered.\nNOTES\n[*]  The right to be free of double jeopardy is subject to an analogous condition, that jeopardy have attached in a prior proceeding, Monge v. California, 524 U.S. 721, 728 (1998), a characteristic that distinguishes the Fifth Amendment right from other immunities mentioned above. But, as we explained, double jeopardy deserves immunity treatment under § 1291 owing to the enormous advantage of a Government prosecutor who chooses to go repeatedly against an individual.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

That judgment of the Ala-\nbama Supreme Court is now reversed by this summary\ndisposition.\n                              I\n   V. L. and E. L. are two women who were in a relation-\nship from approximately 1995 until 2011. Through as-\nsisted reproductive technology, E. L. gave birth to a child\nnamed S. L. in 2002 and to twins named N. L. and H. L. in\n2004. After the children were born, V. L. and E. L. raised\nthem together as joint parents.\n   V. L. and E. L. eventually decided to give legal status to\nthe relationship between V. L. and the children by having\nV. L. formally adopt them. To facilitate the adoption, the\ncouple rented a house in Alpharetta, Georgia. V. L. then\nfiled an adoption petition in the Superior Court of Fulton\nCounty, Georgia. E. L. also appeared in that proceeding.\nWhile not relinquishing her own parental rights, she gave\nher express consent to V. L.’s adoption of the children as a\n2 Va. L. v. E. L.\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nsecond parent. The Georgia court determined that V. L.\nhad complied with the applicable requirements of Georgia\nlaw, and entered a final decree of adoption allowing V. L.\nto adopt the children and recognizing both V. L. and E. L.\nas their legal parents.\n   V. L. and E. L. ended their relationship in 2011, while\nliving in Alabama, and V. L. moved out of the house that\nthe couple had shared. V. L. later filed a petition in the\nCircuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, alleging that\nE. L. had denied her access to the children and interfered\nwith her ability to exercise her parental rights. She asked\nthe Alabama court to register the Georgia adoption judg-\nment and award her some measure of custody or visitation\nrights. The matter was transferred to the Family Court of\nJefferson County. That court entered an order awarding\nV. L. scheduled visitation with the children.\n   E. L. appealed the visitation order to the Alabama Court\nof Civil Appeals. She argued, among other points, that the\nAlabama courts should not recognize the Georgia judg-\nment because the Georgia court lacked subject-matter\njurisdiction to enter it. The Court of Civil Appeals rejected\nthat argument. It held, however, that the Alabama family\ncourt had erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hear-\ning before awarding V. L. visitation rights, and so it re-\nmanded for the family court to conduct that hearing.\n   The Alabama Supreme Court reversed. It held that the\nGeorgia court had no subject-matter jurisdiction under\nGeorgia law to enter a judgment allowing V. L. to adopt\nthe children while still recognizing E. L.’s parental rights.\nAs a consequence, the Alabama Supreme Court held Ala-\nbama courts were not required to accord full faith and\ncredit to the Georgia judgment.\n                           II\n  The Constitution provides that “Full Faith and Credit\nshall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records,\n                  Cite as: 577 U. S. ____ (2016)             3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nand judicial Proceedings of every other State.” U. S.\nConst., Art. IV, §1. That Clause requires each State to\nrecognize and give effect to valid judgments rendered by\nthe courts of its sister States. It serves “to alter the status\nof the several states as independent foreign sovereignties,\neach free to ignore obligations created under the laws or\nby the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make\nthem integral parts of a single nation.” Milwaukee County\nv. M. E. White Co., 296 U.S. 268, 277 (1935).\n   With respect to judgments, “the full faith and credit\nobligation is exacting.” Baker v. General Motors Corp.,\n522 U.S. 222, 233 (1998). “A final judgment in one State,\nif rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the\nsubject matter and persons governed by the judgment,\nqualifies for recognition throughout the land.” Ibid. A\nState may not disregard the judgment of a sister State\nbecause it disagrees with the reasoning underlying the\njudgment or deems it to be wrong on the merits. On the\ncontrary, “the full faith and credit clause of the Constitu-\ntion precludes any inquiry into the merits of the cause of\naction, the logic or consistency of the decision, or the valid-\nity of the legal principles on which the judgment is based.”\nMilliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 462 (1940).\n   A State is not required, however, to afford full faith and\ncredit to a judgment rendered by a court that “did not\nhave jurisdiction over the subject matter or the relevant\nparties.” Underwriters Nat. Assurance Co. v. North Caro-\nlina Life & Accident & Health Ins. Guaranty Assn., 455\nU.S. 691, 705 (1982). “Consequently, before a court is\nbound by [a] judgment rendered in another State, it may\ninquire into the jurisdictional basis of the foreign court’s\ndecree.” Ibid. That jurisdictional inquiry, however, is a\nlimited one. “[I]f the judgment on its face appears to be a\n‘record of a court of general jurisdiction, such jurisdiction\nover the cause and the parties is to be presumed unless\ndisproved by extrinsic evidence, or by the record itself.’ ”\n4 Va. L. v. E. L.\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nMilliken, supra, at 462 (quoting Adam v. Saenger, 303\nU.S. 59, 62 (1938)).\n   Those principles resolve this case. Under Georgia law,\nas relevant here, “[t]he superior courts of the several\ncounties shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all matters of\nadoption.” Ga. Code Ann. §19–8–2(a) (2015). That provi-\nsion on its face gave the Georgia Superior Court subject-\nmatter jurisdiction to hear and decide the adoption peti-\ntion at issue here. The Superior Court resolved that\nmatter by entering a final judgment that made V. L. the\nlegal adoptive parent of the children. Whatever the merits of\nthat judgment, it was within the statutory grant of juris-\ndiction over “all matters of adoption.” Ibid. The Georgia\ncourt thus had the “adjudicatory authority over the subject\nmatter” required to entitle its judgment to full faith and\ncredit. Baker, supra, at 233.\n   The Alabama Supreme Court reached a different result\nby relying on Ga. Code Ann. §19–8–5(a). That statute\nstates (as relevant here) that “a child who has any living\nparent or guardian may be adopted by a third party . . .\nonly if each such living parent and each such guardian has\nvoluntarily and in writing surrendered all of his or her\nrights to such child.” The Alabama Supreme Court con-\ncluded that this provision prohibited the Georgia Superior\nCourt from allowing V. L. to adopt the children while also\nallowing E. L. to keep her existing parental rights. It\nfurther concluded that this provision went not to the\nmerits but to the Georgia court’s subject-matter jurisdic-\ntion. In reaching that crucial second conclusion, the Ala-\nbama Supreme Court seems to have relied solely on the\nfact that the right to adoption under Georgia law is purely\nstatutory, and “ ‘[t]he requirements of Georgia’s adoptions\nstatutes are mandatory and must be strictly construed in\nfavor of the natural parents.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a–\n24a (quoting In re Marks, 300 Ga. App. 239, 243, 684 S.E.\n2d 364, 367 (2009)).\n                  Cite as: 577 U. S. ____ (2016)            5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n   That analysis is not consistent with this Court’s control-\nling precedent. Where a judgment indicates on its face\nthat it was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction,\nsuch jurisdiction “ ‘is to be presumed unless disproved.’ ”\nMilliken, supra, at 462 (quoting Adam, supra, at 62).\nThere is nothing here to rebut that presumption. The\nGeorgia statute on which the Alabama Supreme Court\nrelied, Ga. Code Ann. §19–8–5(a), does not speak in juris-\ndictional terms; for instance, it does not say that a Georgia\ncourt “shall have jurisdiction to enter an adoption decree”\nonly if each existing parent or guardian has surrendered\nhis or her parental rights. Neither the Georgia Supreme\nCourt nor any Georgia appellate court, moreover, has\nconstrued §19–8–5(a) as jurisdictional. That construction\nwould also be difficult to reconcile with Georgia law.\nGeorgia recognizes that in general, subject-matter juris-\ndiction addresses “whether a court has jurisdiction to\ndecide a particular class of cases,” Goodrum v. Goodrum,\n283 Ga. 163, 657 S.E.2d 192 (2008), not whether a court\nshould grant relief in any given case. Unlike §19–8–2(a),\nwhich expressly gives Georgia superior courts “exclusive\njurisdiction in all matters of adoption,” §19–8–5(a) does\nnot speak to whether a court has the power to decide a\ngeneral class of cases. It only provides a rule of decision to\napply in determining if a particular adoption should be\nallowed.\n   Section 19–8–5(a) does not become jurisdictional just\nbecause it is “ ‘mandatory’ ” and “ ‘must be strictly con-\nstrued.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a–24a (quoting Marks,\nsupra, at 243, 684 S.E. 2d, at 367). This Court “has long\nrejected the notion that all mandatory prescriptions,\nhowever emphatic, are properly typed jurisdictional.”\nGonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, ___ (2012) (slip op., at\n10–11) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted).\nIndeed, the Alabama Supreme Court’s reasoning would\ngive jurisdictional status to every requirement of the Geor-\n6 Va. L. v. E. L.\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ngia adoption statutes, since Georgia law indicates those\nrequirements are all mandatory and must be strictly\nconstrued. Marks, supra, at 243, 684 S.E. 2d, at 367.\nThat result would comport neither with Georgia law nor\nwith common sense.\n   As Justice Holmes observed more than a century ago, “it\nsometimes may be difficult to decide whether certain\nwords in a statute are directed to jurisdiction or to merits.”\nFauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U.S. 230, 234–235 (1908). In such\ncases, especially where the Full Faith and Credit Clause is\nconcerned, a court must be “slow to read ambiguous\nwords, as meaning to leave the judgment open to dispute,\nor as intended to do more than fix the rule by which the\ncourt should decide.” Id., at 235. That time-honored rule\ncontrols here. The Georgia judgment appears on its face\nto have been issued by a court with jurisdiction, and there\nis no established Georgia law to the contrary. It follows\nthat the Alabama Supreme Court erred in refusing to\ngrant that judgment full faith and credit.\n   The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judg-\nment of the Alabama Supreme Court is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Estrada argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr., and Matthew D. McGill.\nDan Himmelfarb argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae urging reversal. On the brief were Solicitor General Clement, Assistant Attorney General Keisler, Deputy Solicitor General Garre, James A. Feldman, Mark B. Stern, J. Michael Wiggins, John E. Crowley, Robert Bruce, Amy Wright Larson, and Phillip Christopher Hughey.\nR. Jonathan Hart argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Emily Elizabeth Garrard and David J. Bederman.[*]\nJUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\nPetitioner Northern Insurance Company of New York (Northern) filed suit against respondent Chatham County, Georgia (County), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, seeking damages resulting from an alleged tort committed by employees of the County. The District Court granted the County's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by sovereign immunity. Relying on Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. We granted certiorari to consider \"[w]hether an entity that does not qualify as an `arm of the State' for Eleventh Amendment purposes can nonetheless assert sovereign immunity as a defense to an admiralty suit.\" 546 U.S. 959 (2005).\n\n\n*192 I\nThe County owns, operates, and maintains the Causton Bluff Bridge, a drawbridge over the Wilmington River. On October 6, 2002, James Ludwig requested that the bridge be raised to allow his boat to pass. The bridge malfunctioned, a portion falling and colliding with Mr. Ludwig's boat. As a result of the collision, Mr. Ludwig and his wife incurred damages in excess of $130,000.\nThe Ludwigs submitted a claim for those damages to their insurer, Northern, which paid in accordance with the terms of their insurance policy. Northern then sought to recover its costs by filing suit in admiralty against the County in the District Court. The County sought summary judgment, arguing that Northern's claims were barred by sovereign immunity. The County conceded that Eleventh Amendment immunity did not extend to counties, but nonetheless contended that it was immune under \"the universal rule of state immunity from suit without the state's consent.\" Defendant's Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Case No. CV403-099, App. 33a. The District Court agreed, relying on Broward County v. Wickman, 195 F.2d 614 (CA5 1952), to conclude that sovereign immunity extends to counties and municipalities that, as here, \"exercis[e] power delegated from the State.\" Zurich Ins. Co. v. Chatham County, No. CV403-99, App. 77a.\nThe Eleventh Circuit, which was bound to follow Wickman as Circuit precedent, affirmed.[1] The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the County did not assert an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense, which would fail because, under Circuit precedent, the County did not qualify as an arm of the State. Zurich Ins. Co. v. Chatham County, No. 04-13308 (Jan. 28, 2005), App. 83a, n. 1, judgt. order reported *193 at 129 Fed. Appx. 602. The Court of Appeals nonetheless concluded that \"common law has carved out a `residual immunity,' which would protect a political subdivision such as Chatham County from suit.\" App. 83a. We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\nII\nThis Court's cases have recognized that the immunity of States from suit \"is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today . . . except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments.\" Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713 (1999); see Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55-56 (1996); Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 322-323 (1934). Consistent with this recognition, which no party asks us to reexamine today, we have observed that the phrase \"`Eleventh Amendment immunity' . . . is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, for the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment.\" Alden, 527 U. S., at 713.\nA consequence of this Court's recognition of preratification sovereignty as the source of immunity from suit is that only States and arms of the State possess immunity from suits authorized by federal law. See id., at 740; Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280 (1977). Accordingly, this Court has repeatedly refused to extend sovereign immunity to counties. See Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 401 (1979); id., at 401, n. 19 (gathering cases); Workman v. New York City, 179 U.S. 552, 565 (1900); Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529, 530 (1890). See also Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U.S. 456, 466 (2003) (\"[M]unicipalities, unlike States, do not enjoy a constitutionally protected immunity from suit\"). This is true even when, as respondent alleges here, \"such *194 entities exercise a `slice of state power.'\" Lake Country Estates, supra, at 401.\nThe County argues that this Court's cases recognize a distinct \"residual\" immunity that permits adoption of a broader test than we apply in the Eleventh Amendment context to determine whether an entity is acting as an arm of the State and is accordingly entitled to immunity.[2] Brief for Respondent 28. But this Court's use of that term does not suggest the County's conclusion; instead, this Court has referenced only the States' \"residuary and inviolable sovereignty\" that survived the Constitution. See The Federalist No. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison); Federal Maritime Comm'n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U.S. 743, 751 (2002).\nBecause the County may claim immunity neither based upon its identity as a county nor under an expansive arm-of-the-State test, the County is subject to suit unless it was acting as an arm of the State, as delineated by this Court's precedents, in operating the drawbridge. Alden, supra, at 756; Lake Country Estates, supra, at 400-401. The County conceded below that it was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and both the County and the Court of Appeals appear to have understood this concession to be based on the County's failure to qualify as an arm of the State under our precedent. See App. 83a, n. 1 (recognizing that the County rightly disclaimed an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense because such a defense would be inconsistent *195 with the court's holding in Vierling v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., 339 F.3d 1309 (CA11 2003), that the Broward County Port Authority was not an arm of the State); Brief of Appellee Chatham County in No. 04-13308DD (CA11), p. 13 (distinguishing Vierling in part because it dealt with the question of Eleventh Amendment immunity); see also Brief for Respondent 8 (implicitly conceding that respondent is not an arm of the State under our Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence). Moreover, the question on which we granted certiorari is premised on the conclusion that the County is not \"an `arm of the State' for Eleventh Amendment purposes,\" 546 U.S. 959 (2005), and we presume that to be the case. Accordingly, the County's concession and the presumption underlying the question on which we granted review are dispositive.\nAs an alternative ground for affirmance, the County asks the Court to recognize a distinct sovereign immunity against in personam admiralty suits that bars cases arising from a county's exercise of core state functions with regard to navigable waters. Recognition of a distinct immunity in admiralty cases cannot be reconciled with our precedents. Immunity in admiralty, like other sovereign immunity, is simply an application of \"the fundamental rule\" that \"the entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given.\" Ex parte New York, 256 U.S. 490, 497-500 (1921). Accordingly, this Court has resolved sovereign immunity questions in admiralty by relying upon principles set out in this Court's sovereign immunity cases, rather than by examining the history or jurisprudence specific to suits in admiralty. See Federal Maritime Comm'n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, supra, at 754-769 (an admiralty suit relying heavily on Alden, supra (plaintiff raised a Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 claim), and Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, supra (plaintiff alleged violation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act)). Indeed, *196 the Court applied the general principle that sovereign immunity does not bar a suit against a city to an admiralty suit as early as Workman v. New York City, 179 U.S. 552, which held that such immunity \"afforded no reason for denying redress in a court of admiralty for the wrong which . . . [had] been committed\" by the city of New York, id., at 570.\nThe County nonetheless contendsand the Eleventh Circuit, in reliance upon the Fifth Circuit's analysis in Wickman, heldthat the reach of Workman is limited, and that this Court's decision in Ex parte New York, supra, demonstrates that Workman does not govern the instant case. See Wickman, 195 F. 2d, at 615. We disagree. Ex parte New York extended sovereign immunity beyond cases \"in law or equity\" to cases in admiralty. As the County points out, Ex parte New York concluded that Workman involved only the substantive law of admiralty, and not the power of the Court to exercise jurisdiction over a particular defendant. Ex parte New York, supra, at 498. But Workman dealt only with the substantive law of admiralty precisely because the Workman Court held that admiralty courts have jurisdiction over municipal corporations. See 179 U.S., at 565 (\"[A]s a general rule, municipal corporations, like individuals, may be sued; in other words . . . they are amenable to judicial process for the purpose of compelling performance of their obligations\"). The Workman Court accordingly distinguished between the question before itwhether courts of admiralty may, notwithstanding state law, \"redress a wrong committed by one over whom such courts have adequate jurisdiction,\" id., at 566, such as a municipal corporationand the question not before it, but before the Court in Ex parte New Yorkwhether courts of admiralty may \"give redress in a case where jurisdiction over the person or property cannot be exerted,\" 179 U.S., at 566. In the former circumstance, the court should apply general admiralty principles, while in the latter the court lacks the power to do so. See id., at 570; Ex parte New York, supra, at 499-500, *197 502-503. Because here, as in Workman and in contrast to Ex parte New York, the defendant was an entity generally within the jurisdiction of the District Court, Ex parte New York is inapposite, and Workman compels the conclusion that the County is unprotected by sovereign immunity.\n\n* * *\nBecause the County has failed to demonstrate that it was acting as an arm of the State when it operated the Causton Bluff Bridge, the County is not entitled to immunity from Northern's suit. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\nNOTES\n[*]  Thomas S.

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.CHRISTOPHER  ARTUZ,  SUPERINTENDENT,  GREEN HAVEN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, PETITIONERv.TONY BRUCE BENNETT\nNo. 99-1238.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nArgued October 10, 2000\nDecided November 7, 2000\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nSyllabus\nA New York trial court orally denied respondent's 1995 motion to vacate his state conviction. Subsequently, the Federal District Court dismissed respondent's federal habeas petition as untimely, noting that it was filed more than one year after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). In reversing and remanding, the Second Circuit concluded that 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2), which tolls AEDPA's limitations period during the time that a \"properly filed\" application for state postconviction relief is pending, also tolls the 1-year grace period which the Circuit has allowed for the filing of applications challenging pre-AEDPA convictions; that, in the absence of a written order, respondent's 1995 motion was still pending under §2244(d)(2); and that the 1995 motion was properly filed because it complied with rules governing whether an application for state postconviction relief is \"recognized as such\" under state law. It thus rejected petitioner's contention that the 1995 application was not properly filed because the claims it contained were procedurally barred under New York law.\nHeld: That respondent's application for state postconviction relief contained procedurally barred claims does not render it improperly filed under §2244(d)(2). An application is \"filed,\" as that term is commonly understood, when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record; and it is \"properly filed\" when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings, e.g., requirements concerning the form of the document, applicable time limits upon its delivery, the court and office in which it must be lodged, and payment of a filing fee. By construing \"properly filed application\" to mean application \"raising claims that are not mandatorily procedurally barred,\" petitioner elides the difference between an \"application\" and a \"claim.\" The state procedural bars at issue set forth conditions to obtaining relief, rather than conditions to filing. Pp. 4 7.199 F.3d 116, affirmed.\nScalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nOpinion of the Court\nJustice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nSection 2244(d)(2) of Title 28 U.S.C. (1994 ed., Supp. IV) provides that \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\" This case presents the question whether an application for state postconviction relief containing claims that are procedurally barred is \"properly filed\" within the meaning of this provision.\n\n\n2\n* After a 1984 jury trial in the Supreme Court of New York, Queens County, respondent was convicted of attempted murder, criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of stolen property, and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. The Appellate Division affirmed, and the New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal. After unsuccessfully pursuing state postconviction relief in 1991, respondent in 1995 moved pro se to vacate his judgment of conviction. On November 30, 1995, the state trial court denied the motion in an oral decision on the record; no reasons were given. Respondent claims never to have received a copy of a written order reflecting the denial, despite several written requests.\n\n\n3\nIn February 1998, respondent filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging, inter alia, that the state trial court's refusal to allow a defense witness to testify deprived him of his right to a fair trial and his right to present witnesses in his own defense, that his absence from a pretrial hearing violated due process, and that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to object to allegedly improper remarks made by the prosecutor in summation. The District Court summarily dismissed the petition as untimely, noting that it had been filed more than one year and nine months after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.\n\n\n4\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. 199 F.3d 116 (1999). The panel first concluded that 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. IV), which tolls AEDPA's 1-year period of limitation on habeas corpus applications by state prisoners, should also toll the 1-year grace period (commencing on AEDPA's effective date of April 24, 1996), which the Second Circuit has allowed for the filing of habeas corpus applications challenging pre-AEDPA convictions. See Ross v. Artuz, 150 F.3d 97, 98 (CA2 1998). The panel assumed, for purposes of the appeal, that respondent had not yet received a written order denying his 1995 motion to vacate the conviction. Since respondent could not appeal the denial absent such written order; and since, in the panel's view, \"a state-court petition is 'pending' from the time it is first filed until finally disposed of and further appellate review is unavailable under the particular state's procedures,\" 199 F.3d, at 120; the panel concluded that respondent's 1995 motion was still \"pending\" for purposes of §2244(d)(2). Finally (and this is the sole point on which we granted certiorari), the panel held that respondent's 1995 motion was \"properly filed\" within the meaning of §2244(d)(2) because it complied with those rules \"governing\" whether \"an application for state post-conviction relief [is] recognized as such\" under state law. Id., at 123. It rejected petitioner's contention that the application was not properly filed because the claims it contained were subject to two procedural bars under New York law: a bar against raising an issue that had been \"previously determined on the merits upon an appeal from the judgment,\" N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law §440.10(2)(a) (McKinney 1994), and a bar against raising a claim that was available on direct appeal but was not raised because of the defendant's \"unjustifiable failure,\" §440.10(2)(c).1 199 F.3d, at 123. We granted certiorari. 529 U.S. 1065 (2000).\n\nII\n\n5\nPetitioner contends here, as he did below, that an application for state postconviction or other collateral review is not \"properly filed\" for purposes of §2244(d)(2) unless it complies with all mandatory state-law procedural requirements that would bar review of the merits of the application. We disagree.\n\n\n6\nAn application is \"filed,\" as that term is commonly understood, when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record. See, e.g., United States v. Lombardo, 241 U.S. 73, 76 (1916) (\"A paper is filed when it is delivered to the proper official and by him received and filed\"); Black's Law Dictionary 642 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \"file\" as \"[t]o deliver a legal document to the court clerk or record custodian for placement into the official record\"). And an application is \"properly filed\" when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings. These usually prescribe, for example, the form of the document, the time limits upon its delivery,2 the court and office in which it must be lodged, and the requisite filing fee. See, e.g., Habteselassie v. Novak, 209 F.3d 1208, 1210 1211 (CA10 2000); 199 F.3d, at 121 (case below); Villegas v. Johnson, 184 F.3d 467, 469 470 (CA5 1999); Lovasz v. Vaughn, 134 F.3d 146, 148 (CA3 1998). In some jurisdictions the filing requirements also include, for example, preconditions imposed on particular abusive filers, cf. Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1 (1992) (per curiam), or on all filers generally, cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (conditioning the taking of an appeal on the issuance of a \"certificate of appealability\"). But in common usage, the question whether an application has been \"properly filed\" is quite separate from the question whether the claims contained in the application are meritorious and free of procedural bar.\n\n\n7\nPetitioner contends that such an interpretation of the statutory phrase renders the word \"properly,\" and possibly both words (\"properly filed\"), surplusage, since if the provision omitted those words, and tolled simply for \"[t]he time during which a[n]   application for State post-conviction [relief] is pending,\" it would necessarily condition tolling on compliance with filing requirements of the sort described above. That is not so. If, for example, an application is erroneously accepted by the clerk of a court lacking jurisdiction, or is erroneously accepted without the requisite filing fee, it will be pending, but not properly filed.\n\n\n8\nPetitioner's interpretation is flawed for a more fundamental reason. By construing \"properly filed application\" to mean \"application raising claims that are not mandatorily procedurally barred,\" petitioner elides the difference between an \"application\" and a \"claim.\" Only individual claims, and not the application containing those claims, can be procedurally defaulted under state law pursuant to our holdings in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991), and Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 (1977), which establish the sort of procedural bar on which petitioner relies. Compare §2244(b)(1) (\"A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed\") with §2244(b)(3)(A) (\"Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application\" (emphases added)). See also O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 839 840 (1999) (\"In this case, we are asked to decide whether a state prisoner must present his claims to a state supreme court in a petition for discretionary review in order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement\" (emphases added)). Ignoring this distinction would require judges to engage in verbal gymnastics when an application contains some claims that are procedurally barred and some that are not. Presumably a court would have to say that the application is \"properly filed\" as to the nonbarred claims, and not \"properly filed\" as to the rest. The statute, however, refers only to \"properly filed\" applications and does not contain the peculiar suggestion that a single application can be both \"properly filed\" and not \"properly filed.\" Ordinary English would refer to certain claims as having been properly presented or raised, irrespective of whether the application containing those claims was properly filed.\n\n\n9\nPetitioner's remaining arguments are beside the point. He argues, for example, that tolling for applications that raise procedurally barred claims does nothing to enable the exhaustion of available state remedies which is the object of §2244(d)(2). Respondent counters that petitioner's view would trigger a flood of protective filings in federal courts, absorbing their resources in threshold interpretations of state procedural rules. Whatever merits these and other policy arguments may have, it is not the province of this Court to rewrite the statute to accommodate them. We hold as we do because respondent's view seems to us the only permissible interpretation of the text which may, for all we know, have slighted policy concerns on one or the other side of the issue as part of the legislative compromise that enabled the law to be enacted.\n\nIII\n\n10\nThe state procedural bars at issue in this case N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law §§440.10(2)(a) and (c) (McKinney 1994) simply prescribe a rule of decision for a court confronted with claims that were \"previously determined on the merits upon an appeal from the judgment\" of conviction or that could have been raised on direct appeal but were not: \"[T]he court must deny\" such claims for relief. Neither provision purports to set forth a condition to filing, as opposed to a condition to obtaining relief. Motions to vacate that violate these provisions will not be successful, but they have been properly delivered and accepted so long as the filing conditions have been met. Consequently, the alleged failure of respondent's application to comply with §§440.10(2)(a) and (c) does not render it \"[im]properly filed\" for purposes of §2244(d)(2). The judgment of the Court of Appeals must therefore be affirmed.\n\n\n11\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n1\n  The cited provisions read in full as follows: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one [which sets forth various grounds upon which a court may vacate its earlier judgment], the court must deny a motion to vacate a judgment when:     \"(a) The ground or issue raised upon the motion was previously determined on the merits upon an appeal from the judgment, unless since the time of such appellate determination there has been a retroactively effective change in the law controlling such issue; or .       .       .       .       .     \"(c) Although sufficient facts appear on the record of the proceedings underlying the judgment to have permitted, upon appeal from such judgment, adequate review of the ground or issue raised upon the motion, no such appellate review or determination occurred owing to the defendant's unjustifiable failure to take or perfect an appeal during the prescribed period or to his unjustifiable failure to raise such ground or issue upon an appeal actually perfected by him;   .\" N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law §§440.10(2)(a) and (c) (McKinney 1994).\n\n\n2\n   We express no view on the question whether the existence of certain exceptions to a timely filing requirement can prevent a late application from being considered improperly filed. See, e.g., Smith v. Ward, 209 F.3d 383, 385 (CA5 2000).\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

The assertion of an Eleventh Amendment defense does not vitiate or destroy a federal district court's original jurisdiction over claims involving federal questions or the court's mandatory, supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (1994).\n2. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d) (1994), the limitations period for asserting claims under the Minnesota Human Rights Act is tolled during the pendency of a federal district court action alleging similar claims and claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), even though the federal district court action was ultimately dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds.\n3. When the defendant is not prejudiced and when the plaintiff's decision to file an action including both federal and state claims first in federal district court was legally sound, the limitation period under state law may be equitably tolled pending a decision in federal district court.\nHoward Bolter, Borkon, Ramstead, Mariani & Letourneau, Ltd., 485 Northstar East, 608 Second Ave. S., Minneapolis, MN 55402-1959 (for appellants)\nAndrew D. Parker, Matthew E. Johnson, Smith Parker, P.L.L.P., 808 Colwell Building, 123 North Third St., Minneapolis, MN 55401 (for respondent)\nConsidered and decided by Randall, Presiding Judge, Klaphake, Judge, and Holtan, Judge.*\n\nReversed\nKlaphake, Judge\nOPINION\nKLAPHAKE, Judge\n\n1\nAppellants Lance Raygor and James Goodchild brought this action against their employer, respondent University of Minnesota (University), alleging age discrimination in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA), Minn. Stat. § 363.01-.20 (1996). The University moved to dismiss, arguing that the MHRA's 45-day statute of limitations had lapsed and was not tolled by 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (d) (1994). The district court agreed and granted the University's motion. We reverse.\n\nFACTS\n\n2\nIn August 1995, appellants filed separate charges with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights (MDHR) alleging age discrimination against the University. By letters dated July 17, 1996, the MDHR dismissed the charges and notified appellants that they had 45 days in which to file civil suits in state district court. See Minn. Stat. § 363.14, subd. 1 (1996) (person may bring civil action in state district court within 45 days after receipt of notice that commissioner has dismissed charge).\n\n\n3\nOn August 30, 1996, appellants sued the University in federal district court. They each alleged one claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1974 (ADEA) and one claim under the MHRA. Their actions were consolidated.\n\n\n4\nNine months later, the University moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). The University argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the ADEA and the MHRA claims because the Eleventh Amendment bars suits in federal court against a state by citizens of that or another state. The federal district court granted the University's motion and dismissed appellants' claims without prejudice.\n\n\n5\nAppellants challenged the federal district court's decision in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. That appeal has been stayed pending a decision by the United States Supreme Court in another case involving the issue of whether an ADEA claim against a state is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 139 F.3d 1426 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. granted, 119 S. Ct. 901 (1999).\n\n\n6\nTwenty days after the federal district court dismissed their action, appellants brought this action in state district court alleging age discrimination under the MHRA. This action was stayed for several months pending a decision in the federal appeal. The state district court lifted the stay, however, to allow the University to bring this motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds.\n\nISSUES\n\n7\n1. Did the district court err in concluding that the limitation period for appellants' state action was not tolled while appellants' federal action was pending?\n\n\n8\n2. Did the district court abuse its discretion by rejecting appellants' claim that the limitation period should be equitably tolled?\n\nANALYSIS\nI.\n\n9\nSummary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issues of material fact exist and either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Minn. R. Civ. P. 56.03. When the court examines documents and evidence in addition to the pleadings, a motion to dismiss under Minn. R. Civ. P. 12.02 becomes one for summary judgment. Minn. R. Civ. P. 12.03. Issues involving jurisdiction and application of statutes of limitations require statutory interpretation, which is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. See Boubelik v. Liberty State Bank, 553 N.W.2d 393, 402 (Minn. 1996).\n\n\n10\nThis case involves interpretation of the federal \"Supplemental Jurisdiction\" statute, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n11\n(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) [which discusses diversity jurisdiction] and (c) [which allows court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in certain circumstances, such as when a state law claim raises a novel issue or when all original jurisdiction claims have been dismissed] * * *, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. * * *.\n\n\n12\n* * * *\n\n\n13\n(d) The period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a) * * * shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\n\n\n14\n28 U.S.C. § 1367 (1994).\n\n\n15\nIt is undisputed that the federal district court had original jurisdiction over appellants' ADEA claim, because that claim raised a federal question. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (1994) (\"district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States\"). In addition, the gravamen of both the ADEA and MHRA claims was discrimination based on age. Thus, the federal district court had mandatory, supplemental jurisdiction over appellants' MHRA claim, which was \"so related to [the ADEA claims] that they form[ed] part of the same case or controversy\" under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).\n\n\n16\nNevertheless, the state district court in this case concluded that appellants' claims were not tolled under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d). The court reasoned that because these claims were dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds, the federal district court never had \"original\" jurisdiction over them. Thus, the issue here is whether the Eleventh Amendment divested the federal district court of its original, mandatory, and supplemental jurisdiction, such that jurisdiction never attached.\n\n\n17\nThe Eleventh Amendment has been described as a \"bar[] to federal court jurisdiction over a suit between an unconsenting State and one of its citizens.\" Humenansky v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 152 F.3d 822, 823-24 (8th Cir. 1998) (ADEA claim against University in federal court barred by Eleventh Amendment). The Eleventh Amendment, however, is not a typical jurisdictional limitation because it can be waived and because a federal court has discretion to raise it sua sponte. Parella v. Retirement Bd. of Rhode Island Employees' Retirement Sys., 173 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 1999). Although the Eleventh Amendment provides a state with an immunity defense, it does not necessarily destroy a federal district court's underlying jurisdiction:\n\n\n18\n[B]ecause Eleventh Amendment immunity can be waived, the presence of an Eleventh Amendment issue does not threaten the court's underlying power to declare the law. If this were not the case, sua sponte consideration of a possible Eleventh Amendment bar would have to be obligatory, not discretionary   but the Supreme Court has now clearly stated that courts are free to ignore possible Eleventh Amendment concerns if a defendant chooses not to press them.\n\n\n19\nId. at 55-56 (citing Wisconsin Dep't of Corrections v. Schacht, 118 S. Ct. 2047, 2052-53 (1998)).\n\n\n20\nIn Schacht, the Supreme Court considered whether removal jurisdiction is destroyed when one of the removed claims is subject to an Eleventh Amendment bar. 118 S. Ct. at 2051. Similar to the federal question jurisdiction here, removal jurisdiction requires \"original jurisdiction.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). The Supreme Court concluded that while the Eleventh Amendment may place a particular claim beyond the power of the federal courts to decide, it does not destroy previously existing original jurisdiction. Id., 118 S. Ct. at 2052-53. The Court further recognized the distinction between diversity jurisdiction, which is automatically destroyed if one party is not diverse, and original jurisdiction, which is not destroyed even if the Eleventh Amendment is successfully asserted. Id. Thus, Schacht supports appellants' position that the Eleventh Amendment does not destroy or vitiate original jurisdiction until it is successfully asserted by a state or state entity.\n\n\n21\nThe University argues that even if the federal district court had original jurisdiction over appellants' ADEA claim, 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d) does not toll the limitations period because appellants' state law MHRA claim was not dismissed by the federal district court for one of the reasons enumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c) (federal district court may \"decline\" to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in certain circumstances, including one in which claim raises complex issue of state law or court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction). The University argues that because the federal district court was required to dismiss appellants' state law claim under the Eleventh Amendment, the court did not \"decline\" to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that claim.\n\n\n22\nThe University's argument is partially correct: MHRA claims are subject to the Eleventh Amendment. See, e.g., Mayer v. University of Minn., 940 F. Supp. 1474, 1476 (D. Minn. 1996) (Eleventh Amendment bars federal court jurisdiction over state law claims under the MHRA, against unconsenting states or state officials) (citing Pennhurst State Sch. Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S. Ct. 900 (1984)). Thus, the federal district court in this case may have also dismissed appellants' MHRA claim under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n\n23\nA close reading of 28 U.S.C. § 1367, however, establishes that the tolling provisions of subsection (d) apply to \"any\" claim asserted under subsection (a), which discusses original and supplemental jurisdiction. Subsection (d) does not require a supplemental state law claim to be dismissed for a reason under subsection (c) in order for that claim to be tolled. Rather, subsection (d) expressly states:\n\n\n24\nThe period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a), and for any other claim in the same action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or after the dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\n\n\n25\n28 U.S.C. § 1367(d). Thus, the plain language of subsection (d) allows tolling of any claim dismissed by a federal district court, whether dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds or at the discretion of the federal district court under subsection (c).\n\n\n26\nFinally, at oral arguments before this court, counsel for the University repeatedly represented that \"state law claims against a state can never be brought in federal district court\" and that the \"federal court never had subject matter jurisdiction over the state law claims,\" citing the Supreme Court's decision in Pennhurst. Pennhurst discusses a federal district court's \"pendent\" jurisdiction over state law claims and requires a federal court, once an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense is raised, to \"examine each claim in a case to see if the court's jurisdiction over that claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\" Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 121, 104 S. Ct. at 919. At no point, however, does the Supreme Court discuss \"subject matter jurisdiction\" or hold that the Eleventh Amendment destroys or vitiates subject matter jurisdiction over state law claims.\n\n\n27\nMoreover, Pennhurst was decided in 1984, prior to the 1990 enactment of 28 U.S.C. § 1367, which codified the case law doctrines of \"pendent\" and \"ancillary\" jurisdiction under the name of \"supplemental\" jurisdiction. See David F. Siegel, Practice Commentary, \"The 1990 Adoption of § 1367, Codifying `Supplemental' Jurisdiction,\" reprinted in 28 U.S.C.A. § 1367, at 829 (West 1993). Although Pennhurst remains good law, it must be read in conjunction with 28 U.S.C. § 1367 and with recent cases discussing the Eleventh Amendment, such as Schacht.\n\n\n28\nWe therefore conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the University. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d), the statute of limitations governing appellants' MHRA claim was tolled during the pendency of their federal district court action.\n\nII.\n\n29\nAppellants alternatively argue that the limitation period should be equitably tolled under the facts of this case. The filing requirement of Minn. Stat. § 363.14 is subject to equitable tolling. Ochs v. Streater, Inc., 568 N.W.2d 858, 860 (Minn. App. 1997). Factors to consider include prejudice to a defendant and the conduct of the plaintiff. Id. The burden is on appellants to prove they are entitled to equitable tolling. See Bartlett v. Miller & Schroeder Muns, Inc., 355 N.W.2d 435, 441 (Minn. App. 1984).\n\n\n30\nThere is little or no evidence that the University would be prejudiced if appellants' claims were equitably tolled. Appellants have asserted no new claims in this state district court action. Thus, any discovery the University has undertaken may be used here. Perhaps more importantly, the University could have notified appellants that it would not consent to suit in federal district court, thus allowing appellants time to file in state court; rather, the University waited nine months before asserting its Eleventh Amendment defense. Any prejudice to either party was partly caused by the University's own actions.\n\n\n31\nWith respect to appellants' conduct, the lack of clarity and clear precedent on the issues involved justifies equitable tolling. See Capital Tracing, Inc. v. United States, 63 F.3d 859, 862 (9th Cir. 1995). We cannot fault appellants for failing to simultaneously file identical lawsuits in federal and state courts. At the time appellants brought their action in federal district court, federal law was unclear on whether a state was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from ADEA claims. Indeed, federal circuits are split on this issue, and since the filing of appellants' lawsuit, the Eighth Circuit has taken a minority position and held that the Eleventh Amendment defense is available on ADEA claims against a state. See Humenansky, 152 F.3d at 825 n.2 (noting Eighth Circuit's disagreement with other circuits). Moreover, an appeal taken by appellants to the Eighth Circuit has been held in abeyance pending a decision by the Supreme Court in a case involving this same issue. See Kimel, 139 F.3d 1426. Finally, appellants could reasonable interpret 28 U.S.C. § 1367 as allowing tolling of their claims. Given the lack of clarity in this area, appellants' decision to file suit only in federal district court was legally sound and not based on their attorney's incorrect interpretation of the law. Cf. Ochs, 568 N.W.2d at 860 (equitable tolling not appropriate where plaintiff's choice of remedies based on attorney's incorrect interpretation of law).\n\n\n32\nWe therefore conclude that even if appellants are not entitled to relief under 28 U.S.C. § 1367, their claims were equitably tolled during the pendency of their federal district court action.\n\nDECISION\n\n33\nWe reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to the University. The University's assertion of an Eleventh Amendment defense did not vitiate or destroy the federal district court's underlying original jurisdiction over appellants' ADEA claim or its mandatory, supplemental jurisdiction over appellants' MHRA claim.

Under California law, the malice element needed for a murder conviction is negated if one kills out of fear of imminent peril. If that fear is unreasonable but genuine, California's \"imperfect self-defense\" doctrine reduces the crime to voluntary manslaughter. The voluntary manslaughter jury instruction in this case erroneously defined imminent peril, but the prosecutor's closing statement correctly stated the law. Respondent was convicted of second-degree murder. In affirming, the California Court of Appeal acknowledged the erroneous instruction, but found that the instructions as a whole and the prosecutor's argument made the correct standard clear. The Federal District Court later denied respondent federal habeas relief, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.\nHeld: The Ninth Circuit erred in finding that the erroneous instruction eliminated respondent's imperfect self-defense claim and that the state appellate court unreasonably applied federal law by ignoring the unchallenged and uncorrected instruction. A state prisoner is entitled to federal habeas relief if a state court's adjudication of his constitutional claim was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\" 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d)(1). When a jury instruction fails to give effect to the requirement that a State prove every element of a criminal offense, the question is whether the instruction so infected the entire trial that the conviction violates due process. Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72. Here, the question is whether there is a \"`reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the . . . [ambiguous] instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution.\" Ibid. Given that there were three correct instructions and one contrary one, the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law when it found no reasonable likelihood that the jury was misled by the erroneous instruction. Though the Ninth Circuit also faulted the state court for relying on the prosecutor's argument, nothing in Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, precludes a state court from assuming that counsel's arguments clarified an ambiguous jury charge, particularly when they resolve the ambiguity in the defendant's favor.\nCertiorari granted; 344 F. 3d 988, reversed and remanded.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\n* Respondent Sally Marie McNeil killed her husband after an argument over his infidelity and spending habits. The State of California charged her with murder. Respondent's theory at trial was that her husband had tried to strangle her during the argument, but that she had escaped, fetched a shotgun from the bedroom, and killed him out of fear for her life. Fingernail marks were indeed found on her neck after the shooting. She testified that her husband had been abusive, and a defense expert opined that she suffered from Battered Women's Syndrome. The State countered with forensic evidence showing that the fingernail marks were not her husband's and may have been self-inflicted, and with the testimony of a 911 operator who overheard respondent tell her husband she had shot him because she would no longer tolerate his behavior.\n\n\n2\nUnder California law, \"[m]urder is the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice aforethought.\" Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 187(a) (West 1999). The element of malice is negated if one kills out of fear of imminent peril. In re Christian S., 7 Cal. 4th 768, 773, 872 P. 2d 574, 576 (1994). Where that fear is unreasonable (but nevertheless genuine), it reduces the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughter—a doctrine known as \"imperfect self-defense.\" Ibid. At respondent's trial, the judge instructed the jury on these concepts as follows:\n\n\n3\n\"`The specific intent for voluntary manslaughter, as opposed to murder, must arise upon one of [the] following circumstances:\n\n\n4\n. . . . .\n\n\n5\n\"`[A]n honest but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend oneself against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury. That would be imperfect self-defense.\n\n\n6\n. . . . .\n\n\n7\n\"`To establish that a killing is murder [and] not manslaughter, the burden is on the People to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of murder and that the act which caused the death was not done . . . in the honest, even though unreasonable, belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or to great bodily injury.\n\n\n8\n. . . . .\n\n\n9\n\"`A person, who kills another person in the actual but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury, kills unlawfully, but is not guilty of murder. This would be so even though a reasonable person in the same situation, seeing and knowing the same facts, would not have had the same belief. Such an actual but unreasonable belief is not a defense to the crime of voluntary manslaughter.\n\n\n10\n\"`An \"imminent\" peril is one that is apparent, present, immediate and must be instantly dealt with, or must so appear at the time to the slayer as a reasonable person.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 31-33.\n\n\n11\nThe last four words of this instruction—\"`as a reasonable person'\"—are not part of the relevant form instruction, 1 California Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 5.17 (6th ed. 1996), and were apparently included in error. The prosecutor's closing argument, however, correctly stated the law.\n\n\n12\nRespondent was convicted of second-degree murder and appealed on the basis of the erroneous jury instruction. The California Court of Appeal acknowledged the error but upheld her conviction, reasoning:\n\n\n13\n\"[R]eversal is not required because `[e]rror cannot be predicated upon an isolated phrase, sentence or excerpt from the instructions since the correctness of an instruction is to be determined in its relation to the other instructions and in light of the instructions as a whole.' Here, when all of the jury instructions on voluntary manslaughter and imperfect self-defense, are considered in their entirety, it is not reasonably likely that the jury would have misunderstood the requirements of the imperfect self-defense component of voluntary manslaughter. On the contrary, these instructions repeatedly informed the jury that if the defendant had an honest (or actual) but unreasonable belief in the need to act in self-defense, then the offense would be manslaughter and the defendant could not be convicted of murder. Furthermore, in arguing to the jury, the prosecutor set forth the appropriate standard, stating `[i]f you believe it is an imperfect self-defense, that she actually believed but that a reasonable person would not believe in the necessity for self-defense, that lessens the crime to what is called, \"voluntary manslaughter.\"'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 33-34 (citations omitted).\n\n\n14\nRespondent then sought federal habeas relief. The District Court denied her petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. 344 F. 3d 988 (2003). We now grant the State's petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse.\n\nII\n\n15\nA federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner if a state court's adjudication of his constitutional claim was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d)(1). \"Where, as here, the state court's application of governing federal law is challenged, it must be shown to be not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.\" Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 5 (2003) (per curiam); see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 409 (2000).\n\n\n16\nIn a criminal trial, the State must prove every element of the offense, and a jury instruction violates due process if it fails to give effect to that requirement. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, 520-521 (1979). Nonetheless, not every ambiguity, inconsistency, or deficiency in a jury instruction rises to the level of a due process violation. The question is \"`whether the ailing instruction . . . so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.'\" Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72 (1991) (quoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U. S. 141, 147 (1973)). \"`[A] single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.'\" Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 378 (1990) (quoting Cupp, supra, at 146-147). If the charge as a whole is ambiguous, the question is whether there is a \"`reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution.\" Estelle, supra, at 72 (quoting Boyde, supra, at 380).\n\n\n17\nThe Ninth Circuit held that the erroneous imminent-peril instruction \"eliminated\" respondent's imperfect self-defense claim, and that the state court unreasonably applied federal law by \"completely ignor[ing] unchallenged and uncorrected instructions to the jury.\" 344 F. 3d, at 999. It acknowledged that it was bound to consider the jury charge as a whole, but held that the other instructions were irrelevant because \"[t]he only time that the trial judge actually defined imminent peril for the jury was in the erroneous instruction on imperfect self-defense.\" Id., at 997.\n\n\n18\nThis conclusion failed to give appropriate deference to the state court's decision. Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's description, the state court did not \"ignor[e]\" the faulty instruction. It merely held that the instruction was not reasonably likely to have misled the jury given the multiple other instances (at least three, see supra, at 434-435) where the charge correctly stated that respondent's belief could be unreasonable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34. Given three correct instructions and one contrary one, the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law when it found that there was no reasonable likelihood the jury was misled.\n\n\n19\nThe Ninth Circuit thought that the other references to unreasonableness were irrelevant because they were not part of the definition of \"imminent peril.\" That alone does not make them irrelevant; whether one defines imminent peril in terms of an unreasonable belief or instead describes imperfect self-defense as allowing an unreasonable belief in imminent peril, the import of the instruction is the same. Perhaps the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the erroneous definition of \"imminent peril\" caused the jury to believe that the earlier, correct instructions (\"actual but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril\") meant that, although the belief in the necessity to defend may be unreasonable, the belief in the existence of the \"imminent peril\" may not. This interpretation would require such a rare combination of extremely refined lawyerly parsing of an instruction, and extremely gullible acceptance of a result that makes no conceivable sense, that the state court's implicit rejection of the possibility was surely not an unreasonable application of federal law.\n\n\n20\nThe Ninth Circuit also faulted the state court for relying on the prosecutor's argument, noting that instructions from a judge are presumed to have more influence than arguments of counsel. 344 F. 3d, at 999 (citing Boyde, supra, at 384). But this is not a case where the jury charge clearly says one thing and the prosecutor says the opposite; the instructions were at worst ambiguous because they were internally inconsistent. Nothing in Boyde precludes a state court from assuming that counsel's arguments clarified an ambiguous jury charge. This assumption is particularly apt when it is the prosecutor's argument that resolves an ambiguity in favor of the defendant. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n21\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

This order will free the Court's limited resources to consider the claims of those petitioners who, unlike Day, have not abused the certiorari process.\nMotions denied.\nON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPro se petitioner Roy A. Day requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Day is allowed until November 2, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Day in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\n\n\n2\nDay is an abuser of this Court's certiorari process. We first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Day in forma pauperis status last June. See In re Day, 509 U. S. 902 (1993). At that time he had filed 27 petitions in the past nine years. Although Day was granted in forma pauperis status to file these petitions, all were denied without recorded dissent. Since we first denied him in forma pauperis status last June, he has filed eight more petitions for certiorari with this Court—all of them demonstrably frivolous.\n\n\n3\nAs we have recognized, \"[e]very paper filed with the Clerk of this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources. A part of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests of justice.\" In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 184 (1989) (per curiam). Consideration of Day's repetitious and frivolous petitions for certiorari does not promote this end.\n\n\n4\nWe have entered orders similar to the present one on previous occasions to prevent pro se petitioners from filing repetitious and frivolous requests for certiorari, see Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam), and repetitious and frivolous requests for extraordinary relief. See In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991) (per curiam); In re McDonald, supra.\n\n\n5\nDay's refusal to heed our earlier warning requires us to take this step. His abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not prevent Day from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him. But it will free this Court's limited resources to consider the claims of those petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.\n\n\n6\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Together with No. 92-8792,Day v.

The respondents, Michelle Thomas and her immediate family, applied for asylum. They checked boxes on the application form that indicated their claim rested upon fear of persecution in their native South Africa because of (1) their \"political opinion[s],\" and (2) their \"membership in a particular social group.\" In proceedings before the Immigration Judge, they emphasized their fear of persecution because of their race (they are white) and their kinship with Michelle's father-in-law, \"Boss Ronnie,\" a white South African who allegedly held racist views and mistreated black workers at the company at which he was a foreman. The Immigration Judge, focusing upon questions of race and political views, rejected their claim. And the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), responding to the Thomases' primarily race-related arguments, summarily affirmed that decision.\nOn review, a Ninth Circuit panel held by a 2-to-1 vote that the BIA had not adequately considered the Thomases' claim of persecution because of \"membership in a particular social group, as relatives of Boss Ronnie.\" Thomas v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 1169, 1177 (2004). The Ninth Circuit took the matter en banc. The en banc court, overruling what it considered aberrant contrary Circuit precedent, unanimously held that in principle \"a family may constitute a social group for the purposes of the refugee statutes.\" 409 F.3d 1177, 1187 (2005) (emphasis added) (overruling, inter alia, Estrada-Posadas v. INS, 924 F.2d 916 (CA9 1991)). In so doing, the court relied on earlier BIA opinions holding that certain \"kinship ties\" fall within the statutory term. See 409 F.3d, at 1180, 1184-1186.\nThe court then went on to hold, over the dissent of four judges, that the particular family at issue, namely \"`persons *185 related to Boss Ronnie,'\" fell within the scope of the statutory term \"particular social group\" and that the \"Thomases were attacked and threatened because they belong to the particular social group of `persons related to Boss Ronnie' . . . .\" Id., at 1189. The dissenting judges argued that the question \"whether the Thomases are a `particular social group'\" should first be considered by the relevant administrative agency. Id., at 1193 (opinion of Rymer, J.) (emphasis in original). And they said that the majority's contrary decision was inconsistent with this Court's holding in INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 18 (2002) (per curiam).\nThe Solicitor General now asks us to grant certiorari to consider whether the Ninth Circuit \"erred in holding, in the first instance and without prior resolution of the questions by the\" relevant administrative agency, \"that members of a family can and do constitute a `particular social group,' within the meaning of\" the Act. Pet. for Cert. I. He argues that a court's role in an immigration case is typically one of \"`review, not of first view.'\" Id., at 29 (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005)). He adds that the decision clearly violates what this Court described in Ventura as the \"`ordinary \"remand\" rule.'\" Pet. for Cert. 15 (quoting Ventura, supra, at 18). And he concludes that \"the Ninth Circuit's error is so obvious in light of Ventura that summary reversal would be appropriate.\" Pet. for Cert. 29.\nWe agree with the Solicitor General. The Ninth Circuit's failure to remand is legally erroneous, and that error is \"obvious in light of Ventura,\" itself a summary reversal.\nThe alien in Ventura sought asylum on grounds of a reasonable fear of \"persecution\" in Guatemala \"`on account of . . . [a] political opinion.'\" 537 U.S., at 13. The BIA held that the alien did not qualify for asylum because whatever persecution he faced when he left Guatemala in 1993 was not on account of a \"`political opinion.'\" Ibid. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the record showed that in 1993 *186 the alien did indeed face politically based persecution in Guatemala. The Circuit then went on to consider the Government's alternative argumentthat, in any event, conditions within Guatemala had improved to the point that political persecution was no longer likely. Ibid. And the Circuit rejected this \"`changed circumstances'\" claim without first giving the agency an opportunity to consider the matter. Id., at 14.\nWe reversed the Ninth Circuit summarily. We pointed out that \"[w]ithin broad limits the law entrusts the agency to make the basic asylum eligibility decision.\" Id., at 16. \"In such circumstances,\" we added, a \"`judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.'\" Ibid. (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943)). \"A court of appeals `is not generally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.'\" Ventura, supra, at 16 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985)). \"Rather, `the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.'\" Ventura, supra, at 16 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 744; citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947)). Applying these \"basic legal principles,\" we concluded that \"every consideration that classically supports the law's ordinary remand requirement does so here.\" Ventura, 537 U. S., at 16, 17.\nWe must reach the same conclusion in the present case. The agency has not yet considered whether Boss Ronnie's family presents the kind of \"kinship ties\" that constitute a \"particular social group.\" The matter requires determining the facts and deciding whether the facts as found fall within a statutory term. And as we said in Ventura:\n\"The agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the matter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial determination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed *187 discussion and analysis, help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.\" Id., at 17.\nWe can find no special circumstance here that might have justified the Ninth Circuit's determination of the matter in the first instance. Thus, as in Ventura, the Court of Appeals should have applied the \"ordinary `remand' rule.\" Id., at 18.\nWe grant the petition for certiorari. We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals. And we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

GABBERT\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n[April 5, 1999]\nChief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari in this case, 525 U.S. (1998), to decide whether a prosecutor violates an attorney's Fourteenth Amendment right to practice his profession when the prosecutor causes the attorney to be searched at the same time his client is testifying before a grand jury. We conclude that such conduct by a prosecutor does not violate an attorney's Fourteenth Amendment right to practice his profession.\n\n\n2\nThis case arises out of the high-profile California trials of the \"Menendez Brothers,\" Lyle and Erik Menendez, for the murder of their parents. Petitioners David Conn and Carol Najera are Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorneys, and respondent Paul Gabbert is a criminal defense attorney. In early 1994, after the first Menendez trial ended in a hung jury, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office assigned Conn and Najera to prosecute the case on retrial. Conn and Najera learned that Lyle Menendez had written a letter to Traci Baker, his former girlfriend, in which he may have instructed her to testify falsely at trial. Gabbert represented Baker, who had testified as a defense witness in the first trial. Conn obtained and served Baker with a subpoena directing her to testify before the Los Angeles County grand jury and also directing her to produce at that time any correspondence that she had received from Lyle Menendez. After Gabbert unsuccessfully sought to quash the portion of the subpoena directing Baker to produce the Menendez correspondence, Conn and Najera obtained a warrant to search Baker's apartment for any such correspondence. When police tried to execute the warrant, Baker told the police that she had given all her letters from Menendez to Gabbert.\n\n\n3\nThree days later, on March 21, 1994, Baker appeared as directed before the grand jury, accompanied by Gabbert. Believing that Gabbert might have the letter on his person, Conn directed a police detective to secure a warrant to search Gabbert. California law provides that a warrant to search an attorney must be executed by a court-appointed special master. When the Special Master arrived, Gabbert requested that the search take place in a private room. He did not request that his client's grand jury testimony be postponed. The Special Master searched Gabbert in the private room, and Gabbert produced two pages of a three-page letter from Lyle Menendez to Baker.\n\n\n4\nAt approximately the same time that the search of Gabbert was taking place, Najera called Baker before the grand jury and began to question her. After being sworn, Najera asked Baker whether she was acquainted with Lyle Menendez. Baker replied that she had been unable to speak with her attorney because he was \"still with the special master.\" Brief for Petitioners 6. A short recess was taken during which time Baker was unable to speak with Gabbert. He was aware that Baker sought to speak with him, but apparently stated that the prosecutors would simply have to delay the questioning until they finished searching him. Baker returned to the grand jury room and declined to answer the question \"upon the advice of my counsel\" on the basis of her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Id., at 7. Najera asked a follow-up question, and Baker again asked for a short recess to confer with Gabbert. Baker was again unable to locate Gabbert, and she again returned to the grand jury room and asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege. At this point, the grand jury recessed.\n\n\n5\nBelieving that the actions of the prosecutors were illegal, Gabbert brought suit against them and other officials in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Relevant to this appeal by Conn and Najera, he contended that his Fourteenth Amendment right to practice his profession without unreasonable government interference was violated when the prosecutors executed a search warrant at the same time his client was testifying before the grand jury.* Conn and Najera moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, and the District Court granted the motion.\n\n\n6\nThe Court of Appeals reversed in part, holding that Conn and Najera were not entitled to qualified immunity on Gabbert's Fourteenth Amendment claim. 131 F.3d 793 (CA9 1997). Relying on Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 572 (1972), and earlier cases of this Court recognizing a right to choose one's vocation, the Court of Appeals concluded that Gabbert had a right to practice his profession without undue and unreasonable government interference. 131 F.3d, at 800.  The Court of Appeals also held that based upon notions of \" 'common sense,' \" id., at 801, the right allegedly violated in this case was clearly established, and as a result, Conn and Najera were not entitled to qualified immunity: \"The plain and intended result [of the prosecutors' actions] was to prevent Gabbert from consulting with Baker during her grand jury appearance. These actions were not objectively reasonable, and thus the prosecutors are not protected by qualified immunity from answering Gabbert's Fourteenth Amendment claim.\" Id., at 802 803. We granted certiorari, 525 U.S. (1998), and now reverse.\n\n\n7\nSection 1983 provides a federal cause of action against any person who, acting under color of state law, deprives another of his federal rights. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In order to prevail in a § 1983 action for civil damages from a government official performing discretionary functions, the defense of qualified immunity that our cases have recognized requires that the official be shown to have violated \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Thus a court must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so, proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. See Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232 233 (1991); see also County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 841, n. 5 (1998).\n\n\n8\nWe find no support in our cases for the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that Gabbert had a Fourteenth Amendment right which was violated in this case. The Court of Appeals relied primarily on Board of Regents v. Roth. In Roth, this Court repeated the pronouncement in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, (1923) that the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment \" 'denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized .  .  . as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.' \" Roth, supra, at 572 (quoting Meyer, supra, at 399). But neither Roth nor Meyer even came close to identifying the asserted \"right\" violated by the prosecutors in  this case. Meyer held that substantive due process forebade a State from enacting a statute that prohibited teaching in any language other than English. 262 U.S., at 399, 402 403. And Roth was a procedural due process case which held that an at-will college professor had no \"property\" interest in his job within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment so as to require the university to hold a hearing before terminating him. 408 U.S., at 578. Neither case will bear the weight placed upon it by either the Court of Appeals or Gabbert: Neither case supports the conclusion that the actions of the prosecutors in this case deprived Gabbert of a liberty interest in practicing law.\n\n\n9\nSimilarly, none of the other cases relied upon by the Court of Appeals or suggested by Gabbert provide any more than scant metaphysical support for the idea that the use of a search warrant by government actors violates an attorney's right to practice his profession. In a line of earlier cases, this Court has indicated that the liberty component of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause includes some generalized due process right to choose one's field of private employment, but a right which is nevertheless subject to reasonable government regulation. See, e.g., Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114 (1889) (upholding a requirement of licensing before a person can practice medicine); Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 41 (1915) (invalidating on equal protection grounds a state law requiring companies to employ 80% United States citizens). These cases all deal with a complete prohibition of the right to engage in a calling, and not the sort of brief interruption which occurred here.\n\n\n10\nGabbert also relies on Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of N. M., 353 U.S. 232, 238 239 (1957), for the proposition that a State cannot exclude a person from the practice of law for reasons that contravene the Due Process Clause. Schware held that former membership in the Communist Party and an arrest record relating to union activities could not be the basis for completely excluding a person from the practice of law. Like Dent, supra, and Truax, supra, it does not deal with a brief interruption as a result of legal process. No case of this Court has held that such an intrusion can rise to the level of a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's liberty right to choose and follow one's calling. That right is simply not infringed by the inevitable interruptions of our daily routine as a result of legal process which all of us  may experience from time to time.\n\n\n11\nGabbert next argues that the improper timing of the search interfered with his client's right to have him outside the grand jury room and available to consult with her. A grand jury witness has no constitutional right to have counsel present during the grand jury proceeding, United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564, 581 (1976), and no decision of this Court has held that a grand jury witness has a right to have her attorney present outside the jury room. We need not decide today whether such a right exists, because Gabbert clearly had no standing to raise the alleged infringement of the rights of his client Tracy Baker. \"[T]he plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.\" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975).\n\n\n12\nGabbert of course does have standing to complain of the allegedly unreasonable timing of the execution of the search warrant to prevent him from advising his client. In essence then, he argues that the prosecutors searched him in an unreasonable manner. We have held that where another provision of the Constitution \"provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection,\" a court must assess a plaintiff's claims under that explicit provision and \"not the more generalized notion of 'substantive due process.' \" Graham v. Conner, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989). Challenges to the reasonableness of a search by government agents clearly fall under the Fourth Amendment, and not the Fourteenth.\n\n\n13\nWe hold that the Fourteenth Amendment right to practice one's calling is not violated by the execution of a search warrant, whether calculated to annoy or even to prevent consultation with a grand jury witness. In so holding, we thus of course pretermit the question of whether such a right was \"clearly established\" as of a given day. The judgment of the Court of Appeals holding to the contrary is therefore reversed.\n\n\n14\nIt is so ordered.\n\nNotes\n\n15\n*. * Gabbert also brought a claim under §1983 that Conn and Najera had violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. That claim is not before us and we express no opinion on it.\n\nStevens, J., concurring\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nNo. 97 1802\n\n16\nDAVID CONN and CAROL NAJERA, PETITIONERS v. PAUL L. GABBERT\n\n\n17\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n18\n[April 5, 1999]\n\n\n19\nJustice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n20\nRespondent claims that petitioners violated his constitutional right to practice his profession by unreasonably timing the service and execution of a warrant to search his papers. There is, however, no evidence that respondent's income, reputation, clientele, or professional qualifications were adversely affected by the search. Nor is there any real evidence or allegation that respondent's client was substantially prejudiced by what occurred. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B 17. Accordingly, despite the shabby character of petitioners' conduct, I agree with the Court that it did not deprive respondent of liberty or property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n21\nMy conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed is reached independently of the question whether petitioners may have violated the Fourth Amendment because their method of conducting the search was arguably unreasonable an issue not squarely presented and argued by petitioners in this Court. If their conduct had violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no reason why such a violation would cease to exist just because they also violated some other constitutional provision. Thus the suggestion in the penultimate paragraph of the Court's opinion that the possible existence of a second source of constitutional protection provides a sufficient reason for reversal, ante, at 6 7 is quite unpersuasive. Indeed, if that ground for decision were valid, most of the reasoning in the preceding pages of the Court's opinion would be unnecessary to the decision.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

They told him that they had a federal warrant for his arrest and that a grand jury had indicted him for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. During the course of a brief discussion, petitioner made several inculpatory statements. Once at the county jail, petitioner was advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, signed a waiver of those rights, and reiterated his earlier statements. Before trial, he moved to suppress the inculpatory statements he made at his home and at the jail. A Magistrate Judge recommended that the home statements be suppressed because the officers had not informed petitioner of his Miranda rights, and that portions of his jailhouse statements be suppressed as fruits of the prior failure to provide Miranda warnings. The District Court suppressed the unwarned home statements but admitted the jailhouse statements pursuant to Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, concluding that petitioner had knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights before making the statements. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the conviction, holding that petitioner's jailhouse statements were properly admitted under Elstad, and that the officers had not violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel under Patterson because they did not interrogate him at his home.\nHeld: The Eighth Circuit erred in holding that the absence of an \"interrogation\" foreclosed petitioner's claim that his jailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements taken from him at his home. Pp. 523-525.\n(a) An accused is denied the protections of the Sixth Amendment \"when there [is] used against him at his trial ... his own incriminating words, which federal agents ... deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel.\" Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, 206. This Court has consistently applied the deliberate-elicitation standard in subsequent Sixth Amendment cases, see, e. g., United States v. Henry, 447 U. S. 264, and has expressly distinguished it from the Fifth Amendment custodial-interrogation standard, see, e. g., Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625. There is no question here that the officers \"deliberately elicited\" information from petitioner at his home. Because their discussion took place after petitioner had been indicted, outside the presence of counsel, and in the absence of any waiver of his Sixth Amendment rights, the officers' actions violated the Sixth Amendment standards established in Massiah, supra, and its progeny. Pp. 523-524.\n(b) Because of its erroneous determination that petitioner was not questioned in violation of Sixth Amendment standards, the Eighth Circuit improperly conducted its \"fruits\" analysis under the Fifth Amendment. In applying Elstad, supra, to hold that the admissibility of the jailhouse statements turned solely on whether they were knowing and voluntary, the court did not reach the question whether the Sixth Amendment requires suppression of those statements on the ground that they were the fruits of previous questioning that violated the Sixth Amendment deliberate-elicitation standard. As this Court has not had occasion to decide whether the rationale of Elstad applies when a suspect makes incriminating statements after a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel notwithstanding earlier police questioning in violation of Sixth Amendment standards, the case is remanded to the Eighth Circuit to address this issue in the first instance. Pp. 524-525. 285 F. 3d 721, reversed and remanded.\nO'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\nSeth P. Waxman, by appointment of the Court, 538 U. S. 997, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was Paul R. Q.

Gershowitz.*\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAfter a grand jury indicted petitioner John J. Fellers, police officers arrested him at his home. During the course of the arrest, petitioner made several inculpatory statements. He argued that the officers deliberately elicited these statements from him outside the presence of counsel, and that the admission at trial of the fruits of those statements therefore violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Petitioner contends that in rejecting this argument, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit improperly held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel was \"not applicable\" because \"the officers did not interrogate [petitioner] at his home.\" 285 F. 3d 721, 724 (2002). We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari, 538 U. S. 905 (2003), and now reverse.\n\n\n2\n* On February 24, 2000, after a grand jury indicted petitioner for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, Lincoln Police Sergeant Michael Garnett and Lancaster County Deputy Sheriff Jeff Bliemeister went to petitioner's home in Lincoln, Nebraska, to arrest him. App. 111. The officers knocked on petitioner's door and, when petitioner answered, identified themselves and asked if they could come in. Ibid. Petitioner invited the officers into his living room. Ibid.\n\n\n3\nThe officers advised petitioner they had come to discuss his involvement in methamphetamine distribution. Id., at 112. They informed petitioner that they had a federal warrant for his arrest and that a grand jury had indicted him for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Ibid. The officers told petitioner that the indictment referred to his involvement with certain individuals, four of whom they named. Ibid. Petitioner then told the officers that he knew the four people and had used methamphetamine during his association with them. Ibid.\n\n\n4\nAfter spending about 15 minutes in petitioner's home, the officers transported petitioner to the Lancaster County jail. Ibid. There, the officers advised petitioner for the first time of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285 (1988). App. 112. Petitioner and the two officers signed a Miranda waiver form, and petitioner then reiterated the inculpatory statements he had made earlier, admitted to having associated with other individuals implicated in the charged conspiracy, App. 29-39, and admitted to having loaned money to one of them even though he suspected that she was involved in drug transactions, id., at 34.\n\n\n5\nBefore trial, petitioner moved to suppress the inculpatory statements he made at his home and at the county jail. A Magistrate Judge conducted a hearing and recommended that the statements petitioner made at his home be suppressed because the officers had not informed petitioner of his Miranda rights. App. 110-111. The Magistrate Judge found that petitioner made the statements in response to the officers' \"implici[t] questions,\" noting that the officers had told petitioner that the purpose of their visit was to discuss his use and distribution of methamphetamine. Id., at 110. The Magistrate Judge further recommended that portions of petitioner's jailhouse statement be suppressed as fruits of the prior failure to provide Miranda warnings. App. 110-111.\n\n\n6\nThe District Court suppressed the \"unwarned\" statements petitioner made at his house but admitted petitioner's jailhouse statements pursuant to Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298 (1985), concluding petitioner had knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights before making the statements. App. 112-115.\n\n\n7\nFollowing a jury trial at which petitioner's jailhouse statements were admitted into evidence, petitioner was convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Petitioner appealed, arguing that his jailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements obtained at his home in violation of the Sixth Amendment. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 285 F. 3d 721 (CA8 2002). With respect to petitioner's argument that the officers' failure to administer Miranda warnings at his home violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel under Patterson, supra, the Court of Appeals stated: \"Patterson is not applicable here ... for the officers did not interrogate [petitioner] at his home.\" 285 F. 3d, at 724. The Court of Appeals also concluded that the statements from the jail were properly admitted under the rule of Elstad, supra. 285 F. 3d, at 724 (\"`Though Miranda requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made'\" (quoting Elstad, supra, at 309)).\n\n\n8\nJudge Riley filed a concurring opinion. He concluded that during their conversation at petitioner's home, officers \"deliberately elicited incriminating information\" from petitioner. 285 F. 3d, at 726-727. That \"post-indictment conduct outside the presence of counsel,\" Judge Riley reasoned, violated petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights. Id., at 727. Judge Riley nevertheless concurred in the judgment, concluding that the jailhouse statements were admissible under the rationale of Elstad in light of petitioner's knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel. 285 F. 3d, at 727.\n\nII\n\n9\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered \"at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated... `whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.'\" Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387, 398 (1977) (quoting Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 689 (1972)). We have held that an accused is denied \"the basic protections\" of the Sixth Amendment \"when there [is] used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents ... deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel.\" Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, 206 (1964); cf. Patterson, supra (holding that the Sixth Amendment does not bar postindictment questioning in the absence of counsel if a defendant waives the right to counsel).\n\n\n10\nWe have consistently applied the deliberate-elicitation standard in subsequent Sixth Amendment cases, see United States v. Henry, 447 U. S. 264, 270 (1980) (\"The question here is whether under the facts of this case a Government agent `deliberately elicited' incriminating statements ... within the meaning of Massiah\"); Brewer, supra, at 399 (finding a Sixth Amendment violation where a detective \"deliberately and designedly set out to elicit information from [the suspect]\"), and we have expressly distinguished this standard from the Fifth Amendment custodial-interrogation standard, see Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, 632, n. 5 (1986) (\"[T]he Sixth Amendment provides a right to counsel ... even when there is no interrogation and no Fifth Amendment applicability\"); Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 300, n. 4 (1980) (\"The definitions of `interrogation' under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, if indeed the term `interrogation' is even apt in the Sixth Amendment context, are not necessarily interchangeable\"); cf. United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218 (1967) (holding that the Sixth Amendment provides the right to counsel at a postindictment lineup even though the Fifth Amendment is not implicated).\n\n\n11\nThe Court of Appeals erred in holding that the absence of an \"interrogation\" foreclosed petitioner's claim that the jailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements taken from petitioner at his home. First, there is no question that the officers in this case \"deliberately elicited\" information from petitioner. Indeed, the officers, upon arriving at petitioner's house, informed him that their purpose in coming was to discuss his involvement in the distribution of methamphetamine and his association with certain charged co-conspirators. 285 F. 3d, at 723; App. 112. Because the ensuing discussion took place after petitioner had been indicted, outside the presence of counsel, and in the absence of any waiver of petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the officers' actions did not violate the Sixth Amendment standards established in Massiah, supra, and its progeny.\n\n\n12\nSecond, because of its erroneous determination that petitioner was not questioned in violation of Sixth Amendment standards, the Court of Appeals improperly conducted its \"fruits\" analysis under the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, it applied Elstad, supra, to hold that the admissibility of the jailhouse statements turns solely on whether the statements were \"`knowingly and voluntarily made.'\" 285 F. 3d, at 724 (quoting Elstad, supra, at 309). The Court of Appeals did not reach the question whether the Sixth Amendment requires suppression of petitioner's jailhouse statements on the ground that they were the fruits of previous questioning conducted in violation of the Sixth Amendment deliberate-elicitation standard. We have not had occasion to decide whether the rationale of Elstad applies when a suspect makes incriminating statements after a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel notwithstanding earlier police questioning in violation of Sixth Amendment standards. We therefore remand to the Court of Appeals to address this issue in the first instance.\n\n\n13\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n14\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Kent S.

OTIS LEE RODGERS\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 12–382.    Decided April 1, 2013\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Respondent Otis Lee Rodgers, challenging his state con-\nviction, sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United\nStates District Court for the Central District of California.\nHe claimed the state courts violated his Sixth Amendment\nright to effective assistance of counsel by declining to ap-\npoint an attorney to assist in filing a motion for a new\ntrial notwithstanding his three prior waivers of the right\nto counseled representation. The District Court denied\nrespondent’s petition, and he appealed to the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, which granted habeas\nrelief. 678 F.3d 1149, 1163 (2012). Because the Court\nof Appeals erred in concluding that respondent’s claim is\nsupported by “clearly established Federal law, as deter-\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” 28\nU.S. C. §2254(d)(1), its judgment must be reversed.\n                              I\n  In 2001, the State of California charged respondent with\nmaking criminal threats, assault with a firearm, and be-\ning a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.\nBefore his arraignment, respondent executed a valid\nwaiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, electing\nto represent himself. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S.\n806, 807 (1975). By the time of his preliminary hearing,\nhowever, respondent changed his mind and retained coun-\nsel. Then, two months later, he fired his lawyer and again\nwaived his right to counsel. Two months after that, re-\nspondent again changed his mind and asked the court to\n2                  MARSHALL v. RODGERS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nappoint an attorney. The court did so. Shortly before\ntrial, however, respondent for the third time surrendered\nhis right to counsel. He proceeded to trial pro se. On June\n27, 2003, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.\n   After the verdict was read, respondent asked the state\ntrial court to provide an attorney to help him file a motion\nfor a new trial. The trial judge deferred ruling on the\nmotion to appoint counsel, and respondent later renewed\nthe request in writing. Neither the oral nor the written\nmotion included reasons in support of his request; and\nwhen offered a chance to supplement or explain his motion\nat a later hearing, respondent declined to do so. The trial\ncourt denied the request for counsel. Respondent’s pro se\nmotion for a new trial was likewise denied.\n   On direct review the California Court of Appeal affirmed\nrespondent’s convictions and sentence. As relevant here,\nit concluded that his history of vacillating between coun-\nseled and self-representation, the lack of support for his\nmotion, his demonstrated competence in defending his\ncase, and his insistence that he “ ‘c[ould] do the motion\n[him]self ’ ” but “ ‘just need[ed] time to perfect it,’ ” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 129–130, justified the trial court’s denial\nof his post-trial request for counsel. The state appellate\ncourt also distinguished its decision from that of the Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Menefield v. Borg, 881\nF.2d 696 (1989), reasoning that the habeas petitioner\nin Menefield had stated reasons justifying his request\nfor counsel, whereas respondent’s request was unreasoned\nand unexplained. The state appellate court concluded that\n“[b]ecause the [trial] court was not given any reason to\ngrant [respondent’s] motion, we cannot find that the court\nabused its discretion in declining to do so.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 130.\n   Having failed to obtain relief in state court, respondent\nfiled a federal habeas petition, arguing that the California\ncourts had violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nby not providing an attorney to help with his new-trial\nmotion. The District Court denied the petition but granted\na certificate of appealability. The Court of Appeals re-\nversed, holding that respondent’s “Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel was violated when the trial court denied\nhis timely request for representation for a new trial mo-\ntion.” 678 F. 3d, at 1163.\n   To reach the conclusion that respondent’s right to coun-\nsel in these circumstances was clearly established by the\nSupreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit invoked certain Sixth Amendment\nprecedents from its own earlier cases and from cases in\nother Circuits. From those precedents, the panel identi-\nfied two relevant principles that it deemed to have been\nclearly established by this Court’s cases: first, that a de-\nfendant’s waiver of his right to trial counsel does not bar\nhis later election to receive assistance of counsel at a later\ncritical stage of the prosecution, absent proof by the State\nthat the reappointment request was made in bad faith, see\nid., at 1159–1162; and, second, that a new-trial motion is a\ncritical stage, see id., at 1156–1159. Combining these two\npropositions, the court held that respondent had a clearly\nestablished right to the reappointment of counsel for\npurposes of his new-trial motion, and that the California\ncourts—which vest the trial judge with discretion to ap-\nprove or deny such requests based on the totality of the\ncircumstances, see People v. Lawley, 27 Cal. 4th 102, 147–\n151, 38 P.3d 461, 493–495 (2002)—violated that right by\nrefusing to order the reappointment of counsel. 678 F. 3d,\nat 1162–1163.\n                            II\n  The starting point for cases subject to §2254(d)(1) is to\nidentify the “clearly established Federal law, as deter-\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States” that\ngoverns the habeas petitioner’s claims. See Williams v.\n4                  MARSHALL v. RODGERS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Knowles v. Mirzayance,\n556 U.S. 111, 122 (2009). As indicated above, the parties\nhere dispute whether two principles of law are clearly\nestablished under this framework. One is whether, after a\ndefendant’s valid waiver of his right to trial counsel under\nFaretta, a post-trial, preappeal motion for a new trial is a\ncritical stage of the prosecution. For purposes of analysis\nhere, it will be assumed, without so holding, that it is.\n  The other disputed question is whether, after a defend-\nant’s valid waiver of counsel, a trial judge has discretion\nto deny the defendant’s later request for reappointment of\ncounsel. In resolving this question in respondent’s favor,\nthe Court of Appeals first concluded (correctly) that “the\nSupreme Court has never explicitly addressed a criminal\ndefendant’s ability to re-assert his right to counsel” once\nhe has validly waived it. 678 F. 3d, at 1159 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It then (also correctly) recog-\nnized that the lack of a Supreme Court decision on nearly\nidentical facts does not by itself mean that there is no\nclearly established federal law, since “a general standard”\nfrom this Court’s cases can supply such law. Yarborough\nv. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004). The Court of Ap-\npeals erred, however, in its application of this latter prop-\nosition to the controlling issues here.\n  It is beyond dispute that “[t]he Sixth Amendment safe-\nguards to an accused who faces incarceration the right to\ncounsel at all critical stages of the criminal process.” Iowa\nv. Tovar, 541 U.S. 77, 80–81 (2004); see United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 653–654 (1984); Gideon v. Wain-\nwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963). It is just as well settled,\nhowever, that a defendant also has the right to “proceed\nwithout counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently\nelects to do so.” Faretta, 422 U. S., at 807.\n  There can be some tension in these two principles. As\nthe Faretta Court observed, “[t]here can be no blinking the\nfact that the right of an accused to conduct his own de-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nfense seems to cut against the grain of this Court’s deci-\nsions holding that the Constitution requires that no\naccused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has\nbeen accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.” Id.,\nat 832. California has resolved this tension by adopting\nthe framework under review. Under that approach, trial\njudges are afforded discretion when considering postwaiver\nrequests for counsel; their decisions on such requests\nmust be based on the totality of the circumstances, “in-\nclud[ing] ‘the quality of [the defendant’s] representation\nof [himself], the defendant’s prior proclivity to substitute\ncounsel, the reasons for the request, the length and stage\nof the proceedings, and the disruption or delay [that]\nmight reasonably be expected to follow the granting of\nsuch a motion.’ ” Lawley, supra, at 149, 38 P. 3d, at 494\n(quoting People v. Windham, 19 Cal. 3d 121, 128, 560\nP.2d 1187, 1191–1192 (1977); final alteration in original).\nThe state appellate court applied those rules to the case at\nbar, concluding that the totality of the circumstances—and\nespecially the shifting nature of respondent’s preferences,\nthe unexplained nature of his motion, and his demonstrated\ncapacity to handle the incidents of trial—supported the\ntrial court’s decision. App. to Pet. for Cert. 128–131.\n   The Court of Appeals, however, has resolved that ten-\nsion differently in its own direct-review cases. It has\nadopted a “ ‘strong presumption that a defendant’s post-\ntrial request for the assistance of an attorney should not\nbe refused,’ ” 678 F. 3d, at 1160 (quoting Robinson v. Igna-\ncio, 360 F.3d 1044, 1058 (CA9 2004); emphasis deleted),\nas well as a default rule that, “ ‘in the absence of extraor-\ndinary circumstances,’ a defendant’s post-trial revocation\nof his waiver should be allowed unless the government can\nshow that the request is made ‘for a bad faith purpose,’ ”\nid., at 1058 (quoting Menefield, 881 F. 2d, at 701; empha-\nsis deleted).\n   It is unnecessary for present purposes to judge the\n6                  MARSHALL v. RODGERS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nmerits of these two approaches or determine what rule the\nSixth Amendment in fact establishes for postwaiver re-\nquests of appointment of counsel. All this case requires—\nand all the Court of Appeals was empowered to do under\n§2254(d)(1)—is to observe that, in light of the tension\nbetween the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of “the right\nto counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,”\nTovar, supra, at 80–81, and its concurrent promise of “a\nconstitutional right to proceed without counsel when [a\ncriminal defendant] voluntarily and intelligently elects to\ndo so,” Faretta, supra, at 807, it cannot be said that Cali-\nfornia’s approach is contrary to or an unreasonable ap-\nplication of the “general standard[s]” established by the\nCourt’s assistance-of-counsel cases. Alvarado, supra, at\n664.\n  The Court of Appeals’ contrary conclusion rested in part\non the mistaken belief that circuit precedent may be used\nto refine or sharpen a general principle of Supreme Court\njurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has\nnot announced. Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. ___, ___\n(2012) ( per curiam) (slip op., at 12–13) (“The highly gener-\nalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial\nmisconduct set forth in Darden [v.

The error in this approach is\nsubtle, yet substantial. Although an appellate panel may,\nin accordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures,\nlook to circuit precedent to ascertain whether it has al-\nready held that the particular point in issue is clearly\nestablished by Supreme Court precedent, see, e.g., Tolliver\nv.

W. 2d 601, reversed and remanded.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES119 S.Ct. 484142 L.Ed.2d 492\nNo. 97 7597\n\nPATRICK  KNOWLES,  PETITIONER  v.  IOWA\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF IOWA\n[December 8, 1998]\nChief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAn Iowa police officer stopped petitioner Knowles for speeding, but issued him a citation rather than arresting him. The question presented is whether such a procedure authorizes the officer, consistently with the Fourth Amendment, to conduct a full search of the car. We answer this question \"no.\"\n\n\n2\nKnowles was stopped in Newton, Iowa, after having been clocked driving 43 miles per hour on a road where the speed limit was 25 miles per hour. The police officer issued a citation to Knowles, although under Iowa law he might have arrested him. The officer then conducted a full search of the car, and under the driver's seat he found a bag of marijuana and a \"pot pipe.\" Knowles was then arrested and charged with violation of state laws dealing with controlled substances.\n\n\n3\nBefore trial, Knowles moved to suppress the evidence so obtained. He argued that the search could not be sustained under the \"search incident to arrest\" exception recognized in United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973), because he had not been placed under arrest. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the police officer conceded that he had neither Knowles' consent nor probable cause to conduct the search. He relied on Iowa law dealing with such searches.\n\n\n4\nIowa Code Ann. §321.485(1)(a) (West 1997) provides that Iowa peace officers having cause to believe that a person has violated any traffic or motor vehicle equipment law may arrest the person and immediately take the person before a magistrate. Iowa law also authorizes the far more usual practice of issuing a citation in lieu of arrest or in lieu of continued custody after an initial arrest.1 See Iowa Code Ann. §805.1(1) (West Supp. 1997). Section 805.1(4) provides that the issuance of a citation in lieu of an arrest \"does not affect the officer's authority to conduct an otherwise lawful search.\" The Iowa Supreme Court has interpreted this provision as providing authority to officers to conduct a full-blown search of an automobile and driver in those cases where police elect not to make a custodial arrest and instead issue a citation that is,  a search incident to citation. See State v. Meyer, 543 N. W. 2d 876, 879 (1996); State v. Becker, 458 N. W. 2d 604, 607 (1990).\n\n\n5\nBased on this authority, the trial court denied the motion to suppress and found Knowles guilty. The Supreme Court of Iowa, sitting en banc, affirmed by a divided vote. 569 N. W. 2d 601 (1997). Relying on its earlier opinion in State v. Doran, 563 N. W. 2d 620 (1997), the Iowa Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the search under a bright-line \"search incident to citation\" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, reasoning that so long as the arresting officer had probable cause to make a custodial arrest, there need not in fact have been a custodial arrest. We granted certiorari, 523 U.S. ___ (1998), and we now reverse.\n\n\n6\nThe State contends that Knowles has challenged Iowa Code's §805.1(4) only \"on its face\" and not \"as applied,\" in which case, the argument continues, his challenge would run afoul of Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968). But in his motion to suppress, Knowles argued that \"[b]ecause the officer had no probable cause and no search warrant, and the search cannot otherwise be justified under the Fourth Amendment, the search of the car was unconstitutional.\" App. 7. Knowles did not argue below, and does not argue here, that the statute could never be lawfully applied. The question we therefore address is whether the search at issue, authorized as it was by state law, nonetheless violates the Fourth Amendment.2\n\n\n7\nIn Robinson, supra, we noted the two historical rationales for the \"search incident to arrest\" exception: (1) the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody, and (2) the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial. 414 U.S., at 234. See also United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 802 803 (1974); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 762 763 (1969); Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 367 (1964); Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 30 (1925); Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 392 (1914). But neither of these underlying rationales for the search incident to arrest exception is sufficient to justify the search in the present case.\n\n\n8\nWe have recognized that the first rationale officer safety is \" 'both legitimate and weighty,' \" Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U.S. 408, 412 (1997) (quoting Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 110 (1977) (per curiam)). The threat to officer safety from issuing a traffic citation, however, is a good deal less than in the case of a custodial  arrest. In Robinson, we stated that a custodial arrest involves \"danger to an officer\" because of \"the extended exposure which follows the taking of a suspect into custody and transporting him to the police station.\" 414 U.S., at 234 235. We recognized that \"[t]he danger to the police officer flows from the fact of the arrest, and its attendant proximity, stress, and uncertainty, and not from the grounds for arrest.\" Id., at 234, n. 5. A routine traffic stop, on the other hand, is a relatively brief encounter and \"is more analogous to a so-called 'Terry stop'   than to a formal arrest.\" Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 437 (1984). See also Cupp v. Murphy, 412 U.S. 291, 296 (1973) (\"Where there is no formal arrest . . . a person might well be less hostile to the police and less likely to take conspicuous, immediate steps to destroy incriminating evidence\").\n\n\n9\nThis is not to say that the concern for officer safety is absent in the case of a routine traffic stop. It plainly is not. See Mimms, supra, at 110; Wilson, supra, at 413  414. But while the concern for officer safety in this context may justify the \"minimal\" additional intrusion of ordering a driver and passengers out of the car, it does not by itself justify the often considerably greater intrusion attending a full field-type search. Even without the search authority Iowa urges, officers have other, independent bases to search for weapons and protect themselves from danger. For example, they may order out of a vehicle both the driver, Mimms, supra, at 111, and any passengers, Wilson, supra, at 414; perform a \"patdown\" of a driver and any passengers upon reasonable suspicion that they may be armed and dangerous, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968); conduct a \"Terry patdown\" of the passenger compartment of a vehicle upon reasonable suspicion that an occupant is dangerous and may gain immediate control of a weapon, Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049 (1983); and even conduct a full search of the passenger compartment, including any containers therein, pursuant to a custodial arrest, New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 460 (1981).\n\n\n10\nNor has Iowa shown the second justification for the authority to search incident to arrest the need to discover and preserve evidence. Once Knowles was stopped for speeding and issued a citation, all the evidence necessary to prosecute that offense had been obtained. No further evidence of excessive speed was going to be found either on the person of the offender or in the  passenger compartment of the car.\n\n\n11\nIowa nevertheless argues that a \"search incident to citation\" is justified because a suspect who is subject to a routine traffic stop may attempt to hide or destroy evidence related to his identity (e. g., a driver's license or vehicle registration), or destroy evidence of another, as yet undetected crime. As for the destruction of evidence relating to identity, if a police officer is not satisfied with the identification furnished by the driver, this may be a basis for arresting him rather than merely issuing a citation. As for destroying evidence of other crimes, the possibility that an officer would stumble onto evidence wholly unrelated to the speeding offense seems remote.\n\n\n12\nIn Robinson, we held that the authority to conduct a full field search as incident to an arrest was a \"bright-line rule,\" which was based on the concern for officer safety and destruction or loss of evidence, but which did not depend in every case upon the existence of either concern. Here we are asked to extend that \"bright-line rule\" to a situation where the concern for officer safety is not present to the same extent and the concern for destruction or loss of evidence is not present at all. We decline to do so. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\nNotes\n\n13\n1. Iowa law permits the issuance of a citation in lieu of arrest for most offenses for which an accused person would be \"eligible for bail.\" See Iowa Code Ann. §805.1(1) (West Supp. 1997). In addition to traffic and motor vehicle equipment violations, this would permit the issuance of a citation in lieu of arrest for such serious felonies as second-degree burglary, §713.5 (West Supp. 1997), and first-degree theft, Iowa Code Ann. §714.2(1) (West 1993), both bailable offenses under Iowa law. See §811.1 (West Supp. 1997) (listing all nonbailable offenses). The practice in Iowa of permitting citation in lieu of arrest is consistent with law reform efforts. See 3 W. Lafave, Search and Seizure §5.2(h), p. 99, and n. 151 (3d ed. 1996).\n\n\n14\n2.  Iowa also contends that Knowles' challenge is precluded because he failed to seek review of a separate decision of the Iowa Supreme Court, which affirmed his conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of a city ordinance. That decision, Iowa argues, resulted from the same search at issue here, rejected the same Fourth Amendment challenge Knowles  now makes, and, under principles of res judicata, bars his present challenge. Even if Knowles' failure to seek certiorari review of this decision could preclude his present challenge, Iowa waived this argument by failing to raise it in its brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari. See this Court's Rule 15.2; Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 816 (1985) (\"Nonjurisdictional defects of this sort should be brought to our attention no later than in respondent's brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari; if not, we consider it within our discretion to deem the defect waived\").\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Decided March 6, 2017\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   A Nevada jury convicted petitioner Michael Damon\nRippo of first-degree murder and other offenses and sen-\ntenced him to death. During his trial, Rippo received\ninformation that the judge was the target of a federal\nbribery probe, and he surmised that the Clark County\nDistrict Attorney’s Office—which was prosecuting him—\nwas playing a role in that investigation. Rippo moved for\nthe judge’s disqualification under the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, contending that a judge\ncould not impartially adjudicate a case in which one of the\nparties was criminally investigating him. But the trial\njudge declined to recuse himself, and (after that judge’s\nindictment on federal charges) a different judge later\ndenied Rippo’s motion for a new trial. The Nevada Su-\npreme Court affirmed on direct appeal, reasoning in part\nthat Rippo had not introduced evidence that state authori-\nties were involved in the federal investigation. Rippo v.\nState, 113 Nev. 1239, 1246–1250, 946 P.2d 1017, 1023–\n1024 (1997) ( per curiam).\n   In a later application for state postconviction relief,\nRippo advanced his bias claim once more, this time point-\ning to documents from the judge’s criminal trial indicating\nthat the district attorney’s office had participated in the\ninvestigation of the trial judge. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for\nCert. 236–237, 397. The state postconviction court denied\nrelief, and the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed. Rippo v.\nState, 132 Nev. ___, ___, 368 P.3d 729, 743–745 (2016). It\n2                          RIPPO v. BAKER\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nlikened Rippo’s claim to the “camouflaging bias” theory\nthat this Court discussed in Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S.\n899 (1997). The Bracy petitioner argued that a judge who\naccepts bribes to rule in favor of some defendants would\nseek to disguise that favorable treatment by ruling against\ndefendants who did not bribe him. Id., at 905. We ex-\nplained that despite the “speculative” nature of that theory,\nthe petitioner was entitled to discovery because he had\nalso alleged specific facts suggesting that the judge may\nhave colluded with defense counsel to rush the petitioner’s\ncase to trial. See id., at 905–909. The Nevada Supreme\nCourt reasoned that, in contrast, Rippo was not entitled to\ndiscovery or an evidentiary hearing because his allega-\ntions “d[id] not support the assertion that the trial judge\nwas actually biased in this case.” 132 Nev., at ___, 368\nP. 3d, at 744.*\n   We vacate the Nevada Supreme Court’s judgment be-\ncause it applied the wrong legal standard. Under our\nprecedents, the Due Process Clause may sometimes de-\nmand recusal even when a judge “ ‘ha[s] no actual bias.’ ”\nAetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U.S. 813, 825 (1986).\nRecusal is required when, objectively speaking, “the prob-\nability of actual bias on the part of the judge or deci-\nsionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.”\nWithrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975); see Williams v.\nPennsylvania, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6)\n(“The Court asks not whether a judge harbors an actual,\nsubjective bias, but instead whether, as an objective mat-\nter, the average judge in his position is likely to be neu-\n——————\n  * The court further relied on its bias holding to determine that Rippo\nhad not established cause and prejudice to overcome various state\nprocedural bars. 132 Nev., at ___, 368 P. 3d, at 745. Because the court\nbelow did not invoke any state-law grounds “independent of the merits\nof [Rippo’s] federal constitutional challenge,” we have jurisdiction to\nreview its resolution of federal law. Foster v. Chatman, 578 U. S. ___,\n___ (2016) (slip op., at 8).\n                 Cite as: 580 U.

S. C. § 455(a) because, before his appointment to the bench, his name appeared on a motion to file an amicus brief by the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association (LTLA) in the similar Gilboy suit against some of the same defendants. As he had done in a companion case, Republic of Panama I, the judge refused to disqualify himself on the grounds that he was erroneously listed as LTLA president on the Gilboy motion when he no longer held that post, and that he took no part in preparation or approval of the Gilboy brief. In Republic of Panama I, the judge found it unsurprising that he was unaware of the brief because the LTLA affixed its president's name to all motions to file amicus briefs. The Fifth Circuit reversed, citing its prior decision reversing the judge's order denying recusal in Republic of Panama I.\nHeld: The Fifth Circuit's decision is inconsistent with Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U. S. 847, which stated that § 455(a) requires judicial recusal \"if a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would expect that the judge would have actual knowledge\" of his interest or bias in the case, id., at 861 (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added). The Fifth Circuit considered what a reasonable person would believe without knowing that the judge's name was added mistakenly and without his knowledge to a pro forma motion to file an amicus brief in a separate controversy. The decision whether his impartiality might reasonably be questioned should not have been made in disregard of the facts that he took no part in the preparation or approval of the amicus brief and that he was only vaguely aware of that brief. When those facts are taken into account, it is self-evident that a reasonable person would not believe that he had any interest or bias.\nCertiorari granted; 250 F. 3d 315, reversed and remanded.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nSection 455(a) of 28 U. S. C. (1994 ed.) provides that a judge \"shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" In this tobacco-products liability case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that § 455(a) required disqualification of a District Judge whose name appeared erroneously, prior to his appointment to the bench, on a motion to file an amicus brief in a similar suit against some of the same defendants. Republic of Panama v. American Tobacco Co., 250 F. 3d 315 (2001) (per curiam) (Republic of Panama II). We grant the writ of certiorari and reverse.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner, Sao Paulo State, brought this suit against respondent tobacco companies in Louisiana state court. It alleged that respondents had conspired to conceal the health risks of smoking, thereby preventing it from adopting policies that would have reduced smoking by Sao Paulo citizens. It seeks compensation for the costs of treating their smoking-related health problems. The suit was removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana and assigned to District Judge Carl J. Barbier, who had presided over a companion case, Republic of Panama v. American Tobacco Co., No. 98-3279, 1999 WL 350030 (ED La., May 28, 1999) (Republic of Panama I), vacated and remanded, 217 F. 3d 343 (CA5 2000). As in that case, respondents filed a motion seeking Judge Barbier's recusal under § 455(a) because of his involvement, prior to appointment to the bench, in a similar suit against some of the respondents.\n\n\n3\nAlmost nine years before the present suit was commenced, Judge Barbier's name appeared on a motion to file an amicus curiae brief in Gilboy v. American Tobacco Co., 582 So. 2d 1263 (La. 1991). The motion was submitted by the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association (LTLA), and erroneously listed Judge Barbier as the association's president, a position from which he had retired about six months earlier. The motion also correctly listed as a member of the LTLA's amicus curiae committee which approved the brief Michael St. Martin, who represents petitioner in the case before us. The amicus brief itself — which did not list either Judge Barbier or Mr. St. Martin — supported the Gilboy plaintiff's claim that cigarettes are addictive and cause cancer, and that the defendants failed to warn consumers about these dangers. Brief for LTLA as Amicus Curiae in No. 90-C-2686 (La. Sup. Ct.), App. to Brief in Opposition 9a; Gilboy, supra, at 1266.\n\n\n4\nRespondents argued that Judge Barbier's association with the Gilboy amicus brief created an \"appearance of partiality\" requiring disqualification under § 455(a). Brief in Opposition 3. Judge Barbier disagreed. Adopting his reasons for denying recusal in Republic of Panama I, he refused to disqualify himself because his name appeared in error on the motion to file the amicus brief and because he took no part in preparation or approval of the brief.

Indeed, he was previously unaware of it, which he found unsurprising because the LTLA affixed the president's name to all motions to file amicus briefs, despite the fact that the president had absolutely no role in preparation or approval of the briefs.

Judge Barbier also noted in Republic of Panama I that he had never practiced law with Mr. St. Martin or any other lawyer listed on the motion, had no personal knowledge of the disputed facts in Gilboy, had never taken a position with respect to any of the issues raised in petitioner's suit, and had never been involved in a tobacco-related case \"one way or another in my whole legal career.\" Tr. of Status Conf. 9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a. See also Tr. of Proceeding 39-40, App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a-51a.\n\n\n5\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, citing its prior decision reversing Judge Barbier's order denying recusal in Republic of Panama I. In that case, the Fifth Circuit said:\n\n\n6\n\"The fact that Judge Barbier's name was listed on a motion to file an amicus brief which asserted similar allegations against tobacco companies to the ones made in this case may lead a reasonable person to doubt his impartiality. Also, Judge Barbier was listed on this filing with the attorney who is currently representing the Republic of Panama. The trial judge's assertions that he did not participate directly in the writing or researching of the amicus brief do not dissipate the doubts that a reasonable person would probably have about the court's impartiality. We acknowledge that this is a close case for recusal.\" 217 F. 3d, at 347.\n\n\n7\nJudge Parker concurred, agreeing that the court was bound by its decision in Republic of Panama I, but arguing that that decision was \"erroneous because it requires recusal on the basis of a judge's public statements on the law made prior to becoming a judge ....\" Republic of Panama II, supra, at 318. Rehearing en banc was denied over the dissent of six judges, who argued that the decision below amounts to an \"issue recusal\" rule, requiring disqualification whenever a judge has pre-judicial association with a legal position. 265 F. 3d 299, 306 (2001) (joint dissent of Wiener and Parker, JJ.).\n\n\n8\nWe need not consider the argument advanced by the dissenting judges, since this case is easily disposed of on other grounds. The Fifth Circuit's decision is inconsistent with Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U. S. 847 (1988), which stated that § 455(a) requires judicial recusal \"if a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would expect that the judge would have actual knowledge\" of his interest or bias in the case. Id., at 861 (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added). The Fifth Circuit reached the conclusion that recusal was required because it considered what a reasonable person would believe without knowing (or giving due weight to the fact) that the judge's name was added mistakenly and without his knowledge to a pro forma motion to file an amicus brief in a separate controversy. Although Judge Barbier was indeed a leader of the LTLA at that time (he was a member of the association's executive committee), he took no part in the preparation or approval of the amicus brief; indeed, he was only \"vaguely aware\" of the case. Tr. of Status Conf. 8, App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a. The decision whether his \"impartiality might reasonably be questioned\" should not have been made in disregard of these facts; and when they are taken into account we think it self-evident that a reasonable person would not believe he had any interest or bias.\n\n\n9\nAccordingly, we grant the petition for certiorari, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n10\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

A California jury convicted him of murder and sentenced him to death. The State Supreme Court affirmed. In subsequently denying his state habeas corpus petition, that court assumed that respondent's trial counsel provided constitutionally inadequate representation during the trial's penalty phase, but found that it did not prejudice the jury's sentencing decision. The Federal District Court later granted respondent federal habeas relief as to his sentence, finding that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the State Supreme Court's decision ran afoul of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) because it was \"contrary to\" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, and an \"unreasonable application\" of this Court's clearly established principles.\nHeld: The Ninth Circuit's decision exceeds § 2254(d)'s limits on federal habeas review. First, that court erred in holding that the state court applied the wrong standard for evaluating prejudice. Under Strickland, a defendant need only establish a \"reasonable probability\" that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of his sentencing proceeding would have been different. Id., at 694. Strickland specifically rejected a higher standard: that the defendant must prove it more likely than not that the outcome would have been altered. Id., at 693. The Ninth Circuit erred in finding that the State Supreme Court held respondent to this higher standard because it used \"probable\" without the modifier \"reasonably\" in three places in its opinion. The Ninth Circuit's readiness to attribute error is inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and follow the law, and is incompatible with § 2254(d)'s highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings. The Ninth Circuit also erred in finding that the state-court decision involved an unreasonable application of this Court's clearly established precedents. There is no support for the conclusion that the state court failed to take into account the totality of the available mitigating evidence and to consider the prejudicial impact of counsel's actions. The state court found that, because the aggravating factors were so severe, respondent suffered no prejudice from trial counsel's (assumed) inadequacy. Whether or not a federal habeas court would have reached that same conclusion, habeas relief is not permissible under § 2254(d) unless the state court's decision is objectively unreasonable.\nCertiorari granted; 288 F.3d 1097, reversed.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the grant of habeas relief to respondent John Visciotti after concluding that he had been prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. 288 F.3d 1097 (2002). Because this decision exceeds the limits imposed on federal habeas review by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), we reverse.\n\n\n2\n* Respondent and a co-worker, Brian Hefner, devised a plan to rob two fellow employees, Timothy Dykstra and Michael Wolbert, on November 8, 1982, their payday. They invited the pair to join them at a party. As the four were driving to that supposed destination in Wolbert's car, respondent asked Wolbert to stop in a remote area so that he could relieve himself. When all four men had left the car, respondent pulled a gun, demanded the victims' wallets (which turned out to be almost empty), and got Wolbert to tell him where in the car the cash was hidden. After Hefner had retrieved the cash, respondent walked over to the seated Dykstra and killed him with a shot in the chest from a distance of three or four feet. Respondent then raised the gun in both hands and shot Wolbert three times, in the torso and left shoulder, and finally, from a distance of about two feet, in the left eye. Respondent and Hefner fled the scene in Wolbert's car. Wolbert miraculously survived to testify against them.\n\n\n3\nRespondent was convicted by a California jury of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and armed robbery, with a special-circumstance finding that the murder was committed during the commission of a robbery. The same jury determined that respondent should suffer death. The California Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. People v. Visciotti, 2 Cal. 4th 1, 825 P.2d 388 (1992).\n\n\n4\nRespondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the California Supreme Court, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. That court appointed a referee to hold an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact—after which, and after briefing on the merits, it denied the petition in a lengthy opinion. In re Visciotti, 14 Cal. 4th 325, 926 P.2d 987 (1996). The California Supreme Court assumed that respondent's trial counsel provided constitutionally inadequate representation during the penalty phase, but concluded that this did not prejudice the jury's sentencing decision. Id., at 353, 356-357, 926 P.2d, at 1004, 1006.\n\n\n5\nRespondent filed a federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. That court determined that respondent had been denied effective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of his trial, and granted the habeas petition as to his sentence. The State appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n\n6\nThe Court of Appeals correctly observed that a federal habeas application can only be granted if it meets the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), which provides:\n\n\n7\n\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim—\n\n\n8\n\"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n\n9\n\"(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"\n\n\n10\nThe Court of Appeals found that the California Supreme Court decision ran afoul of both the \"contrary to\" and the \"unreasonable application\" conditions of § 2254(d)(1), and affirmed the District Court's grant of relief. See 288 F.3d, at 1118-1119. The State of California petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we now grant along with respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.\n\nII\n\n11\n* We consider first the Ninth Circuit's holding that the California Supreme Court's decision was \"contrary to\" our decision in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Strickland held that to prove prejudice the defendant must establish a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\" id., at 694 (emphasis added); it specifically rejected the proposition that the defendant had to prove it more likely than not that the outcome would have been altered, id., at 693. The Court of Appeals read the State Supreme Court opinion in this case as applying the latter test— as requiring respondent to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the result of the sentencing proceedings would have been different. See 288 F.3d, at 1108-1109. That is, in our view, a mischaracterization of the state-court opinion, which expressed and applied the proper standard for evaluating prejudice.\n\n\n12\nThe California Supreme Court began its analysis of the prejudice inquiry by setting forth the \"reasonable probability\" criterion, with a citation of the relevant passage in Strickland; and it proceeded to state that \"[t]he question we must answer is whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors and omissions, the sentencing authority would have found that the balance of aggravating and mitigating factors did not warrant imposition of the death penalty,\" again with a citation of Strickland. In re Visciotti, 14 Cal. 4th, at 352, 926 P.2d, at 1003 (citing Strickland, supra, at 696). Twice, the court framed its inquiry as turning on whether there was a \"reasonable probability\" that the sentencing jury would have reached a more favorable penalty-phase verdict. 14 Cal. 4th, at 352, 353, 926 P.2d, at 1003, 1004. The following passage, moreover, was central to the California Supreme Court's analysis:\n\n\n13\n\"In In re Fields, . . . we addressed the process by which the court assesses prejudice at the penalty phase of a capital trial at which counsel was, allegedly, incompetent in failing to present mitigating evidence: `What kind of evidentiary showing will undermine confidence in the outcome of a penalty trial that has resulted in a death verdict? Strickland . . . and the cases it cites offer some guidance. United States v. Agurs . . ., the first case cited by Strickland, spoke of evidence which raised a reasonable doubt, although not necessarily of such character as to create a substantial likelihood of acquittal. . . . United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal . . ., the second case cited by Strickland, referred to evidence which is \"material and favorable . . . in ways not merely cumulative. . . .\"'\" Id., at 353-354, 926 P.2d, at 1004.\n\n\n14\n\"Undermin[ing] confidence in the outcome\" is exactly Strickland's description of what is meant by the \"reasonable probability\" standard. \"A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Strickland, supra, at 694.\n\n\n15\nDespite all these citations of, and quotations from, Strickland, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the California Supreme Court had held respondent to a standard of proof higher than what that case prescribes for one reason: in three places (there was in fact a fourth) the opinion used the term \"probable\" without the modifier \"reasonably.\" 288 F.3d, at 1108-1109, and n. 11. This was error. The California Supreme Court's opinion painstakingly describes the Strickland standard. Its occasional shorthand reference to that standard by use of the term \"probable\" without the modifier may perhaps be imprecise, but if so it can no more be considered a repudiation of the standard than can this Court's own occasional indulgence in the same imprecision. See Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 166 (2002) (\"probable effect upon the outcome\"); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 393 (2000) (\"probably affected the outcome\").\n\n\n16\nThe Court of Appeals made no effort to reconcile the state court's use of the term \"probable\" with its use, elsewhere, of Strickland's term \"reasonably probable,\" nor did it even acknowledge, much less discuss, the California Supreme Court's proper framing of the question as whether the evidence \"undermines confidence\" in the outcome of the sentencing proceeding. This readiness to attribute error is inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and follow the law. See, e.g., Parker v. Dugger, 498 U.S. 308, 314-316 (1991); Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 653 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002); LaVallee v. Delle Rose, 410 U.S. 690, 694-695 (1973) (per curiam). It is also incompatible with § 2254(d)'s \"highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,\" Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), which demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nB\n\n17\nThe Court of Appeals also held that, regardless of whether the California Supreme Court applied the proper standard for determining prejudice under Strickland, its decision involved an unreasonable application of our clearly established precedents. 288 F.3d, at 1118. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the determination that Visciotti suffered no prejudice as a result of his trial counsel's deficiencies was \"objectively unreasonable.\" Ibid. Under § 2254(d)'s \"unreasonable application\" clause, a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the state-court decision applied Strickland incorrectly. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 698-699 (2002); Williams, supra, at 411. Rather, it is the habeas applicant's burden to show that the state court applied Strickland to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner. An \"unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.\" Williams, supra, at 410; see Bell, supra, at 694. The Ninth Circuit did not observe this distinction, but ultimately substituted its own judgment for that of the state court, in contravention of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n\n\n18\nThe Ninth Circuit based its conclusion of \"objective unreasonableness\" upon its perception (1) that the California Supreme Court failed to \"take into account\" the totality of the available mitigating evidence, and \"to consider\" the prejudicial impact of certain of counsel's actions, and (2) that the \"aggravating factors were not overwhelming.\" 288 F.3d, at 1118. There is no support for the first of these contentions. All of the mitigating evidence, and all of counsel's prejudicial actions, that the Ninth Circuit specifically referred to as having been left out of account or consideration were in fact described in the California Supreme Court's lengthy and careful opinion. The Court of Appeals asserted that the California Supreme Court \"completely ignored the mitigating effect of Visciotti's brain damage,\" and failed to consider the prejudicial effect of counsel's \"multiple concessions during closing argument.\" Ibid. However, the California Supreme Court specifically considered the fact that an expert \"had testified at the guilt phase that [Visciotti] had a minimal brain injury of a type associated with impulse disorder and learning disorder.\" In re Visciotti, 14 Cal. 4th, at 354, 926 P.2d, at 1004. And it noted that under the trial court's instructions, this and other evidence that had been introduced \"might have been considered mitigating at the penalty phase,\" despite trial counsel's concessions during closing argument. Ibid. The California Supreme Court then focused on counsel's failure to introduce mitigating evidence about respondent's background, including expert testimony that could have been presented about his \"growing up in a dysfunctional family in which he suffered continual psychological abuse.\" Id., at 355, 926 P.2d, at 1005. This discussion referred back to a lengthy, detailed discussion about the undiscovered mitigating evidence that trial counsel might have presented during the penalty phase. See id., at 341-345, 926 P.2d, at 996-998. The California Supreme Court concluded that despite the failure to present evidence of respondent's \"troubled family background,\" id., at 355, 926 P.2d, at 1005, which included his being \"berated,\" being \"markedly lacking in self-esteem and depressed,\" having been \"born with club feet,\" having \"feelings of inadequacy, incompetence, inferiority,\" and the like, moving \"20 times\" while he was growing up, and possibly suffering a \"seizure disorder,\" id., at 341-343, 926 P.2d, at 996-998, the aggravating factors were overwhelming. In the state court's judgment, the circumstances of the crime (a cold-blooded execution-style killing of one victim and attempted execution-style killing of another, both during the course of a preplanned armed robbery) coupled with the aggravating evidence of prior offenses (the knifing of one man, and the stabbing of a pregnant woman as she lay in bed trying to protect her unborn baby) was devastating. See id., at 355, 926 P.2d, at 1005; see also People v. Visciotti, 2 Cal. 4th, at 33-34, 825 P.2d, at 402. The California Supreme Court found these aggravating factors to be so severe that it concluded respondent suffered no prejudice from trial counsel's (assumed) inadequacy. In re Visciotti, supra, at 355, 926 P.2d, at 1005.\n\n\n19\nThe Court of Appeals disagreed with this assessment, suggesting that the fact that the jury deliberated for a full day and requested additional guidance on the meaning of \"moral justification\" and \"extreme duress\" meant that the \"aggravating factors were not overwhelming.\" 288 F.3d, at 1118. Perhaps so. However, \"under § 2254(d)(1), it is not enough to convince a federal habeas court that, in its independent judgment, the state-court decision applied Strickland incorrectly.\" Bell, 535 U.S., at 699. The federal habeas scheme leaves primary responsibility with the state courts for these judgments, and authorizes federal-court intervention only when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable. It is not that here. Whether or not we would reach the same conclusion as the California Supreme Court, \"we think at the very least that the state court's contrary assessment was not `unreasonable.'\" Id., at 701. Habeas relief is therefore not permissible under § 2254(d).\n\n\n20\n*   *   *\n\n\n21\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is\n\n\n22\n\nReversed.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

GARRISON  et al.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n[December 14, 1998]\nChief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner Michael A. Haddle, an at-will employee, alleges that respondents conspired to have him fired from his job in retaliation for obeying a federal grand jury subpoena and to deter him from testifying at a federal criminal trial. We hold that such interference with at-will employment may give rise to a claim for damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat §1980, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2).\n\n\n2\nAccording to petitioner's complaint, a federal grand jury indictment in March 1995 charged petitioner's employer, Healthmaster, Inc., and respondents Jeanette Garrison and Dennis Kelly, officers of Healthmaster, with Medicare fraud. Petitioner cooperated with the federal agents in the investigation that preceded the indictment. He also appeared to testify before the grand jury pursuant to a subpoena, but did not testify due to the press of time. Petitioner was also expected to appear as a witness in the criminal trial resulting from the indictment.\n\n\n3\nAlthough Garrison and Kelly were barred by the Bankruptcy Court from participating in the affairs of Healthmaster, they conspired with G. Peter Molloy, Jr., one of the remaining officers of Healthmaster, to bring about petitioner's termination. They did this both to intimidate petitioner and to retaliate against him for his attendance at the federal-court proceedings.\n\n\n4\nPetitioner sued for damages in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, asserting a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2) and various state-law claims. Petitioner stated two grounds for relief under §1985(2): one for conspiracy to deter him from testifying in the upcoming criminal trial and one for conspiracy to retaliate against him for attending the grand jury proceedings. As §1985 demands, he also alleged that he had been \"injured in his person or property\" by the acts of respondents in violation of §1985(2) and that he was entitled to recover his damages  occasioned by such injury against respondents jointly and severally.\n\n\n5\nRespondents moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Because petitioner conceded that he was an at-will employee, the District Court granted the motion on the authority of Morast v. Lance, 807 F.2d 926 (1987). In Morast, the Eleventh Circuit held that an at-will employee who is dismissed pursuant to a conspiracy proscribed by §1985(2) has no cause of action. The Morast court explained that \"to make out a cause of action under §1985(2) the plaintiff must have suffered an actual injury. Because Morast was an at will employee, . . . he had no constitutionally protected interest in continued employment. Therefore, Morast's discharge did not constitute an actual injury under this statute.\" Id., at 930. Relying on its decision in Morast, the Court of Appeals affirmed. Judgt. order reported at 132 F.3d 46 (1997).\n\n\n6\nThe Eleventh Circuit's rule in Morast conflicts with the holdings of the First and Ninth Circuits. See Irizarry v. Quiros, 722 F.2d 868, 871 (CA1 1983), and Portman v. County of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 909 910 (CA9 1993). We therefore granted certiorari, 523 U.S. __ (1998), to decide whether petitioner was \"injured in his property or person\" when respondents induced his employer to terminate petitioner's at-will employment as part of a conspiracy prohibited by §1985(2).\n\n\n7\nSection 1985(2), in relevant part, proscribes conspiracies to \"deter, by force, intimidation, or threat, any party or witness in any court of the United States from attending such court, or from testifying to any matter pending therein, freely, fully, and truthfully, or to injure such party or witness in his person or property on account of his having so attended or testified.\"1 The statute provides that if one or more persons engaged in such a conspiracy \"do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, . . . the party so injured   may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury   against any one or more of the conspirators.\" §1985(3). 2\n\n\n8\nPetitioner's action was dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because, in the Eleventh Circuit's view, he had not suffered an injury that could give rise to a claim for damages under §1985(2). We must, of course, assume that the facts as alleged in petitioner's complaint are true and that respondents engaged in a  conspiracy prohibited by §1985(2). Our review in this case is accordingly confined to one question: Can petitioner state a claim for damages by alleging that a conspiracy proscribed by §1985(2) induced his employer to terminate his at-will employment?3\n\n\n9\nWe disagree with the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion that petitioner must suffer an injury to a \"constitutionally protected property interest\" to state a claim for damages under §1985(2). Nothing in the language or purpose of the proscriptions in the first clause of §1985(2), nor in its attendant remedial provisions, establishes such a requirement. The gist of the wrong at which §1985(2) is directed is not deprivation of property, but intimidation or retaliation against witnesses in federal-court proceedings. The terms \"injured in his person or property\" define the harm that the victim may suffer as a result of the conspiracy to intimidate or retaliate. Thus, the fact that employment at will is not \"property\" for purposes of the Due Process Clause, see Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 345 347 (1976), does not mean that loss of at-will employment may not \"injur[e] [petitioner] in his person or property\" for purposes of §1985(2).\n\n\n10\nWe hold that the sort of harm alleged by petitioner here essentially third-party interference with at-will employment relationships states a claim for relief under §1985(2). Such harm has long been a compensable injury under tort law, and we see no reason to ignore this tradition in this case. As Thomas Cooley recognized:\n\n\n11\n\"One who maliciously and without justifiable cause, induces an employer to discharge an employee, by means of false statements, threats or putting in fear, or perhaps by means of malevolent advice and persuasion, is liable in an action of tort to the employee for the damages thereby sustained. And it makes no difference whether the employment was for a fixed term not yet expired or is terminable at the will of the employer.\" 2 T. Cooley, Law of Torts 589 91 (3d ed. 1906) (emphasis added).\n\n\n12\nThis Court also recognized in Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33 (1915):\n\n\n13\n\"The fact that the employment is at the will of the parties, respectively, does not make it one at the will of others. The employe has manifest interest in the freedom of the employer to exercise his judgment without illegal interference or compulsion and, by the weight of authority, the unjustified interference of third persons is actionable although the employment is at will.\" Id., at 38 (citing cases).\n\n\n14\nThe kind of interference with at-will employment relations alleged here is merely a  species of the traditional torts of intentional interference with contractual relations and intentional interference with prospective contractual relations. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §766, Comment g, pp.10 11 (1977); see also id., §766B, Comment c, at 22. This protection against third-party interference with at-will employment relations is still afforded by state law today. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keaton on Law of Torts §129, pp. 995 996, and n. 83 (5th ed. 1984) (citing cases). For example, the State of Georgia, where the acts underlying the complaint in this case took place, provides a cause of action against third parties for wrongful interference with employment relations. See Georgia Power Co. v. Busbin, 242 Ga. 612, 613, 250 S. E. 2d 442, 444 (1978) (\"[E]ven though a person's employment contract is at will, he has a valuable contract right which may not be unlawfully interfered with by a third person\"); see also Troy v. Interfinancial, Inc., 171 Ga. App. 763, 766 769, 320 S. E. 2d 872, 877 879 (1984) (directed verdict inappropriate against defendant who procured plaintiff's termination for failure to lie at a deposition hearing).4 Thus, to the extent that the terms \"injured in his person or property\" in §1985 refer to principles of tort law, see 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 118 (1768) (describing the universe of common law torts as \"all private wrongs, or civil injuries, which may be offered to the rights of either a man's person or his property\"), we find ample support for our holding that the harm occasioned by the conspiracy here may give rise to a claim for damages under §1985(2).\n\n\n15\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nNotes\n\n16\n1.  Section 1985(2) proscribes the following conspiracies: \"If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire to deter, by force, intimidation, or threat, any party or witness in any court of the United States from attending such court, or from testifying to any matter pending therein, freely, fully, and truthfully, or to injure such party or witness in his person or property on account of his having so attended or testified, or to influence the verdict, presentment, or indictment of any grand or petit juror in any such court, or to injure such juror in his person or property on account of any verdict, presentment, or indictment lawfully assented to by him, or of his being or having been such juror; or if two or more persons  conspire for the purpose of impeding, hindering, obstructing, or defeating, in any manner, the due course of justice in any State or Territory, with intent to deny to any citizen the equal protection of the laws, or to injure him or his property for lawfully enforcing, or attempting to enforce, the right of any person, or class of persons, to the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\n\n17\n2.  Section 1985(3) contains the remedial provision granting a cause of action for damages to those harmed by any of the conspiracies prohibited in §1985. See Kush v. Rutledge, 460 U.S. 719, 724 725 (1983) (listing the various conspiracies that §1985 prohibits).\n\n\n18\n3. We express no opinion regarding respondents' argument that intimidation claims under §1985(2) are limited to conduct involving force or threat of force, or their argument that only litigants, and not witnesses, may bring §1985(2) claims. We leave those issues for the courts below to resolve on remand.\n\n\n19\n4.  Petitioner did bring a claim for tortious interference with his employment relation against respondents in Georgia state court, but that claim was dismissed on summary judgment and the dismissal affirmed on appeal. The ultimate course of petitioner's state-law claim, however, has no bearing on whether he can state a claim for damages under §1985(2) in federal court.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

DONNA \n\n                   KAY LEE\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 15–789.    Decided May 31, 2016\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Federal habeas courts generally refuse to hear claims\n“defaulted . . . in state court pursuant to an independent\nand adequate state procedural rule.” Coleman v. Thomp-\nson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991). State rules count as “ade-\nquate” if they are “firmly established and regularly fol-\nlowed.” Walker v. Martin, 562 U.S. 307, 316 (2011)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Like all States, Cali-\nfornia requires criminal defendants to raise available\nclaims on direct appeal. Under the so-called “Dixon bar,” a\ndefendant procedurally defaults a claim raised for the first\ntime on state collateral review if he could have raised it\nearlier on direct appeal. See In re Dixon, 41 Cal. 2d 756,\n759, 264 P.2d 513, 514 (1953). Yet, in this case, the Ninth\nCircuit held that the Dixon bar is inadequate to bar fed-\neral habeas review. Because California’s procedural bar is\nlongstanding, oft-cited, and shared by habeas courts\nacross the Nation, this Court now summarily reverses the\nNinth Circuit’s judgment.\n                              I\n  Respondent Donna Kay Lee and her boyfriend Paul\nCarasi stabbed to death Carasi’s mother and his ex-\ngirlfriend. A California jury convicted the pair of two\ncounts each of first-degree murder. Carasi received a\ndeath sentence, and Lee received a sentence of life without\nthe possibility of parole. In June 1999, Lee unsuccessfully\nraised four claims on direct appeal. After the California\n2                    JOHNSON v. LEE\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nappellate courts affirmed, Lee skipped state postconviction\nreview and filed the federal habeas petition at issue. See\n28 U.S. C. §2254(a). The petition raised mostly new\nclaims that Lee failed to raise on direct appeal. Because\nLee had not exhausted available state-court remedies,\nhowever, the District Court temporarily stayed federal\nproceedings to allow Lee to pursue her new claims in a\nstate habeas petition. The California Supreme Court\ndenied Lee’s petition in a summary order citing Dixon.\n   Having exhausted state remedies, Lee returned to fed-\neral court to litigate her federal habeas petition. The\nDistrict Court dismissed her new claims as procedurally\ndefaulted. Then, for the first time on appeal, Lee chal-\nlenged the Dixon bar’s adequacy. In her brief, Lee pre-\nsented a small sample of the California Supreme Court’s\nstate habeas denials on a single day about six months\nafter her default. Lee claimed that out of the 210 sum-\nmary denials on December 21, 1999, the court failed to cite\nDixon in 9 cases where it should have been applied. The\ncourt instead denied the nine petitions without any cita-\ntion at all. In Lee’s view, these missing citations proved\nthat the California courts inconsistently applied the Dixon\nbar. Without evaluating this evidence, the Ninth Circuit\nreversed and remanded “to permit the Warden to submit\nevidence to the contrary, and for consideration by the\ndistrict court in the first instance.” Lee v. Jacquez, 406\nFed. Appx. 148, 150 (2010).\n   On remand, the warden submitted a study analyzing\nmore than 4,700 summary habeas denials during a nearly\n2-year period around the time of Lee’s procedural default.\nFrom August 1998 to June 2000, the study showed, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court cited Dixon in approximately\n12% of all denials—more than 500 times. In light of this\nevidence, the District Court held that the Dixon bar is\nadequate.\n   The Ninth Circuit again reversed. Lee v. Jacquez, 788\n                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nF. 3d 1124 (2015). Lee’s 1-day sample proved the Dixon\nbar’s inadequacy, the court held, because the “failure to\ncite Dixon where Dixon applies . . . reflects [its] irregular\napplication.” 788 F.3d, at 1130. The general 12% citation\nrate proved nothing, the court reasoned, because the\nwarden “d[id] not purport to show to how many cases the\nDixon bar should have been applied.” Id., at 1133. In\nthe Ninth Circuit’s view, without this “baseline number” the\nwarden’s 2-year study was “entirely insufficient” to prove\nDixon’s adequacy. 788 F.3d, at 1133.\n                             II\n   The Ninth Circuit’s decision profoundly misapprehends\nwhat makes a state procedural bar “adequate.” That\nquestion is a matter of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534\nU.S. 362, 375 (2002). “To qualify as an ‘adequate’ proce-\ndural ground,” capable of barring federal habeas review, “a\nstate rule must be ‘firmly established and regularly fol-\nlowed.’ ” Martin, supra, at 316 (quoting Beard v. Kindler,\n558 U.S. 53, 60 (2009)).\n   California’s Dixon bar satisfies both adequacy criteria.\nIt is “firmly established” because, decades before Lee’s\nJune 1999 procedural default, the California Supreme\nCourt warned defendants in plain terms that, absent\n“special circumstances,” habeas “will not lie where the\nclaimed errors could have been, but were not, raised upon\na timely appeal from a judgment of conviction.” Dixon,\nsupra, at 759, 264 P. 2d, at 514. And the California Su-\npreme Court eliminated any arguable ambiguity surround-\ning this bar by reaffirming Dixon in two cases decided\nbefore Lee’s default. See In re Harris, 5 Cal. 4th 813,\n825, n. 3, 829–841, 855 P.2d 391, 395, n. 3, 398–407\n(1993); In re Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 814–815, and n. 34,\n959 P.2d 311, 340–341, and n. 34 (1998).\n   The California Supreme Court’s repeated Dixon cita-\ntions also prove that the bar is “regularly followed.” Mar-\n4                     JOHNSON v. LEE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ntin recently held that another California procedural bar—\na rule requiring prisoners to file state habeas petitions\npromptly—met that requirement because “[e]ach year, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of\nhabeas petitions by citing” the timeliness rule. 562 U.S.,\nat 318. The same goes for Dixon. Nine purportedly miss-\ning Dixon citations from Lee’s 1-day sample of summary\norders hardly support an inference of inconsistency. See\nDugger v. Adams, 489 U.S. 401, 410, n. 6 (1989) (holding\nthat the Florida Supreme Court applied its similar proce-\ndural bar “consistently and regularly” despite “ad-\ndress[ing] the merits in several cases raising [new] claims\non postconviction review”). Indeed, all nine orders in that\nsample were denials. None ignored the Dixon bar to grant\nrelief, so there is no sign of inconsistency.\n   Nor is California’s rule unique. Federal and state ha-\nbeas courts across the country follow the same rule as Dixon.\n“The general rule in federal habeas cases is that a defend-\nant who fails to raise a claim on direct appeal is barred\nfrom raising the claim on collateral review.” Sanchez-\nLlamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S. 331, 350–351 (2006). Like-\nwise, state postconviction remedies generally “may not be\nused to litigate claims which were or could have been\nraised at trial or on direct appeal.” 1 D. Wilkes, State\nPostconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook §1:2, p. 3\n(2015–2016 ed.). It appears that every State shares this\nprocedural bar in some form. See Brief for State of Ala-\nbama et al. as Amici Curiae 1, n. 2 (collecting citations).\nFor such well-established and ubiquitous rules, it takes\nmore than a few outliers to show inadequacy. Federal\nhabeas courts must not lightly “disregard state procedural\nrules that are substantially similar to those to which we\ngive full force in our own courts.” Kindler, 558 U.S., at\n62. And it would be “[e]ven stranger to do so with respect\nto rules in place in nearly every State.” Ibid. Nothing\nsuggests, moreover, that California courts apply the Dixon\n                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nbar in a way that disfavors federal claims. The Court\ntherefore holds that it qualifies as adequate to bar federal\nhabeas review.\n                              III\n  The Ninth Circuit’s contrary reasoning is unpersuasive\nand inconsistent with this Court’s precedents. Applying\nthe Dixon bar may be a “straightforward” or “mechani-\nca[l]” task for state courts. 788 F.3d, at 1130. But sim-\nplicity does not imply that missing citations reflect state-\ncourt inconsistency. To begin with, since the Dixon bar\nhas several exceptions, see Robbins, supra, at 814–815,\nand n. 34, 959 P.2d, at 340–341, and n. 34, the California\nSupreme Court can hardly be faulted for failing to cite\nDixon whenever a petitioner raises a claim that he could\nhave raised on direct appeal.\n  More importantly, California courts need not address\nprocedural default before reaching the merits, so the\npurportedly missing citations show nothing. Cf. Bell v.\nCone, 543 U.S. 447, 451, n. 3 (2005) ( per curiam) (declin-\ning to address the warden’s procedural-default argument);\nLambrix v. Singletary, 520 U.S. 518, 525 (1997) (explain-\ning that “[ j]udicial economy might counsel” bypassing a\nprocedural-default question if the merits “were easily\nresolvable against the habeas petitioner”). Ordinarily,\n“procedural default . . . is not a jurisdictional matter.”\nTrest v. Cain, 522 U.S. 87, 89 (1997). As a result, the\nappropriate order of analysis for each case remains within\nthe state courts’ discretion. Such discretion will often lead\nto “seeming inconsistencies.” Martin, 562 U.S., at 320,\nand n. 7. But that superficial tension does not make a\nprocedural bar inadequate. “[A] state procedural bar may\ncount as an adequate and independent ground for denying\na federal habeas petition even if the state court had dis-\ncretion to reach the merits despite the default.” Id., at\n311; see Kindler, supra, at 60–61.\n6                     JOHNSON v. LEE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   The Ninth Circuit’s attempt to get around Martin and\nKindler fails. The Court of Appeals distinguished those\ncases on the ground that California’s Dixon bar is “man-\ndatory” rather than discretionary because it involves a\ndiscretion-free general rule, notwithstanding exceptions that\nmight involve discretion. 788 F.3d, at 1130. The Court\nassumes, without deciding, that this description is accu-\nrate and the Dixon bar’s exceptions leave some room for\ndiscretion. Even so, there is little difference between\ndiscretion exercised through an otherwise adequate proce-\ndural bar’s exceptions and discretion that is a part of the\nbar itself. In any event, the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning\nignores the state courts’ discretion to assume, without\ndeciding, that a claim is not procedurally defaulted and\ninstead hold that the claim lacks merit.\n   The Ninth Circuit was accordingly wrong to dismiss the\n500-plus summary denials citing Dixon simply because\nthey do not reveal which cases potentially implicate the\nbar. 788 F.3d, at 1133. Martin already rejected this\nprecise reasoning. There, the habeas petitioner unsuccess-\nfully argued that “[u]se of summary denials makes it\nimpossible to tell why the California Supreme Court de-\ncides some delayed petitions on the merits and rejects\nothers as untimely.” 562 U.S., at 319 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). So too here, “[w]e see no reason to reject\nCalifornia’s [procedural] bar simply because a court may\nopt to bypass the [Dixon] assessment and summarily\ndismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.”\nIbid.\n   By treating every missing citation as a sign of incon-\nsistency, the Court of Appeals “pose[d] an unnecessary\ndilemma” for California. Kindler, 558 U.S., at 61. The\ncourt forced the State to choose between the “finality of\n[its] judgments” and a burdensome opinion-writing re-\nquirement. Ibid.; see Martin, supra, at 312–313 (noting\nthat the California Supreme Court “rules on a staggering\n                  Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)                  7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nnumber of habeas petitions each year”); Harrington v.\nRichter, 562 U.S. 86, 99 (2011) (discussing the advantages\nof summary dispositions). “[F]ederal courts have no au-\nthority,” however, “to impose mandatory opinion-writing\nstandards on state courts” as the price of federal respect\nfor their procedural rules. Johnson v. Williams, 568 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). The Ninth Circuit’s decision\nis thus fundamentally at odds with the “federalism and\ncomity concerns that motivate the adequate state ground\ndoctrine in the habeas context.” Kindler, supra, at 62.\n                       *     *     *\n  “A State’s procedural rules are of vital importance to the\norderly administration of its criminal courts; when a\nfederal court permits them to be readily evaded, it under-\nmines the criminal justice system.” Lambrix, supra, at\n525. Here, the Ninth Circuit permitted California prison-\ners to evade a well-established procedural bar that is\nadequate to bar federal habeas review. The petition for a\nwrit of certiorari and respondent’s motion to proceed in\nforma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Respondent was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. After unsuccessfully moving for a new trial, he sought state postconviction relief, alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to conduct an adequate investigation. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. The trial court denied relief after an evidentiary hearing, finding that counsel's performance was not deficient and that, in any event, respondent suffered no prejudice. Respondent then moved for a new trial, claiming for the first time—after seven years—that Gooch would testify that she was not with Hughes on the night in question. The trial court denied the motion. In affirming that denial, the State Court of Criminal Appeals found that respondent had filed an earlier such motion and given no satisfactory reason for failing to locate Gooch in seven years, and that Gooch's testimony would only impeach Hughes' memory. In affirming the denial of postconviction relief, the court noted that there had been no showing on the record of favorable evidence that counsel could have elicited from Gooch and that respondent's pleading did not contradict what Hughes claimed to have seen. The Federal District Court granted the State summary judgment on respondent's subsequent federal habeas claim, finding the state court's application of Strickland erroneous but not unreasonable within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that the state court had unreasonably applied Strickland, given that Gooch's statement undermined Hughes' credibility, and finding that the state court's opinion was contrary to Strickland because it assessed prejudice under a preponderance-of-the-evidence, rather than a reasonable-probability, standard.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit erred in granting relief under § 2254(d)(1). First, it found the state court's application of Strickland unreasonable on the basis of evidence not properly before the state court. Although the state court ventured that it would deny relief on the merits taking Gooch's statement into account, its judgment also rested on the holding that her statement was not properly before it. Granting relief in disregard of this independent basis for decision was error, for the question whether a state court's decision was unreasonable must be assessed in light of the record before that court, see, e. g., Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 6. Second, the Sixth Circuit erred in holding that the state court required proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The state court recited the correct reasonable-probability standard, but the Sixth Circuit inferred from three subsequent passages in the state court's opinion that the state court had actually applied a preponderance standard. In doing so, the Sixth Circuit ignored § 2254(d)'s requirements that \"state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,\" Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24, and that \"readiness to attribute error is inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and follow the law,\" ibid.\nCertiorari granted; 80 Fed. Appx. 392, reversed and remanded.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\n* Respondent Jessie Jackson was tried in 1987 by the State of Tennessee for the murder of James Crawley. The State asserted that he had shot Crawley after an argument over drugs. Its principal evidence at trial was the eyewitness testimony of Jonathan Hughes, who claimed to have been at the scene with his girlfriend Melissa Gooch when the shooting occurred. Gooch did not testify. The jury convicted, and respondent was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n\n2\nAfter unsuccessfully moving for a new trial, respondent sought state postconviction relief, alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to conduct an adequate investigation. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The state court held an evidentiary hearing and then denied the petition, finding that counsel's performance was not deficient and that, in any event, respondent suffered no prejudice. Respondent then filed a \"Motion for Hearing in Nature of Motion for New Trial,\" alleging newly discovered evidence. He claimed for the first time—seven years after his conviction—that Gooch would now testify that, contrary to Hughes' trial testimony, she was not with Hughes on the night of the shooting. The state court denied this motion, and respondent appealed both rulings to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.\n\n\n3\nThat court affirmed. It upheld the denial of new trial, observing that respondent had already filed an earlier such motion, that there was \"no satisfactory reason given for the defendant's failure to locate this witness\" during the seven years that had elapsed, and that the proposed testimony \"would serve merely to impeach Hughes' memory about having seen [Gooch] that night.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 88. It also affirmed the denial of postconviction relief, noting that there had never \"been any showing on the record of favorable testimony that would have been elicited\" from Gooch had counsel interviewed her, and that even crediting respondent's \"unsubstantiated pleading,\" \"it in no way rises to the level of contradicting what Hughes claims to have seen\" respecting the shooting itself. Id., at 96-97 (emphasis added).\n\n\n4\nRespondent then sought federal habeas relief, and the District Court granted the State's motion for summary judgment. It found that there had been ineffective assistance of counsel, noting several shortcomings and opining that there was a reasonable probability of prejudice. It observed, however, that it could grant relief only if the state court's adjudication of respondent's claim was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\" 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d)(1). It concluded that the state court's application of Strickland, while erroneous, was not unreasonable.\n\n\n5\nThe Sixth Circuit reversed. 80 Fed. Appx. 392 (2003). Although it found a number of flaws in counsel's performance, its grant of relief under § 2254(d)(1) was based on only two specific grounds: first, that the state court had unreasonably applied Strickland, given that Gooch's statement undermined the credibility of Hughes' testimony; and second, that the state court's opinion was contrary to Strickland because it assessed prejudice under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard rather than a reasonable-probability standard.\n\n\n6\nWe now grant the State's petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse.\n\nII\n\n7\n* The Sixth Circuit erred in finding the state court's application of Strickland unreasonable on the basis of evidence not properly before the state court. Although the state court had ventured that it would deny relief on the merits even taking Gooch's statement into account, its judgment also rested on the holding that the statement was not properly before it. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 86-89, 95-98. Granting relief in disregard of this independent basis for decision was error.\n\n\n8\nThe \"unreasonable application\" clause of § 2254(d)(1) applies when the \"state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 413 (2000). In this and related contexts we have made clear that whether a state court's decision was unreasonable must be assessed in light of the record the court had before it. See Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 6 (2003) (per curiam) (denying relief where state court's application of federal law was \"supported by the record\"); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 348 (2003) (reasonableness of state court's factual finding assessed \"in light of the record before the court\"); cf. Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 697, n. 4 (2002) (declining to consider evidence not presented to state court in determining whether its decision was contrary to federal law).\n\n\n9\nUnder the habeas statute, Gooch's statement could have been the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the District Court, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to develop that evidence in state court, or (if he was at fault) if the conditions prescribed by § 2254(e)(2) were met. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431-437 (2000). Those same restrictions apply a fortiori when a prisoner seeks relief based on new evidence without an evidentiary hearing. See, e. g., Cargle v. Mullin, 317 F. 3d 1196, 1209 (CA10 2003), and cases cited. Where new evidence is admitted, some Courts of Appeals have conducted de novo review on the theory that there is no relevant state-court determination to which one could defer. See, e.g., Monroe v. Angelone, 323 F. 3d 286, 297-299, and n. 19 (CA4 2003). Assuming, arguendo, that this analysis is correct and that it applies where, as here, the evidence does not support a new claim but merely buttresses a previously rejected one, it cannot support the Sixth Circuit's action.\n\n\n10\nThe District Court made no finding that respondent had been diligent in pursuing Gooch's testimony (and thus that § 2254(e)(2) was inapplicable) or that the limitations set forth in § 2254(e)(2) were met. Nor did the Sixth Circuit independently inquire into these matters; it simply ignored entirely the state court's independent ground for its decision, that Gooch's statement was not properly before it. It is difficult to see, moreover, how respondent could claim due diligence given the 7-year delay. He complains that his state postconviction counsel did not heed his pleas for assistance. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 65. Attorney negligence, however, is chargeable to the client and precludes relief unless the conditions of § 2254(e)(2) are satisfied. See Williams, supra, at 439-440; cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753-754 (1991).\n\n\n11\nThe Sixth Circuit therefore erred in finding the state court's decision an unreasonable application of Strickland.*\n\nB\n\n12\nThe Sixth Circuit also erred in holding that the state court acted contrary to federal law by requiring proof of prejudice by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by a reasonable probability. The state court began by reciting the correct Strickland standard:\n\n\n13\n\"`[T]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 95 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694).\n\n\n14\nThe Sixth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the state court had actually applied a preponderance standard, based on three subsequent passages from its opinion.\n\n\n15\nFirst was the statement that \"[i]n a post-conviction proceeding, the defendant has the burden of proving his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 95. In context, however, this statement is reasonably read as addressing the general burden of proof in postconviction proceedings with regard to factual contentions—for example, those relating to whether defense counsel's performance was deficient. Although it is possible to read it as referring also to the question whether the deficiency was prejudicial, thereby supplanting Strickland, such a reading would needlessly create internal inconsistency in the opinion.\n\n\n16\nSecond was the statement that \"it is asking too much that we draw the inference that the jury would not have believed Hughes at all had Melissa Gooch testified.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 96. Although the Court of Appeals evidently thought that this passage intimated a preponderance standard, it is difficult to see why. The quoted language does not imply any particular standard of probability.\n\n\n17\nLast was the statement that respondent had \"failed to carry his burden of proving that the outcome of the trial would probably have been different but for those errors.\" Id., at 98. We have held that such use of the unadorned word \"probably\" is permissible shorthand when the complete Strickland standard is elsewhere recited. See Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 23-24 (2002) (per curiam).\n\n\n18\nAs we explained in Visciotti, § 2254(d) requires that \"state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\" Id., at 24. \"[R]eadiness to attribute error is inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and follow the law.\" Ibid. The Sixth Circuit ignored those prescriptions.\n\n\n19\n* * *\n\n\n20\nThe judgment of the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n21\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n22\nJUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n We reject respondent's contention that the State failed adequately to preserve this error.

Petitioner was charged in Louisiana state court with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the warrantless entry, arrest, and search, and petitioner was convicted. In holding that the officers' conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment because they had probable cause to arrest petitioner, the State Court of Appeal declined to decide whether exigent circumstances were present. The State Supreme Court denied review.\nHeld: The Court of Appeal erred in finding that exigent circumstances were not required to justify the officers' conduct. Its reasoning plainly violates the holding in Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 590, that the firm line at the entrance to a house may not be crossed without a warrant, absent exigent circumstances. Here, police had neither an arrest nor a search warrant. Although the officers testified at the suppression hearing that they took action out of fear that evidence would be destroyed, the Louisiana Court of Appeal did not determine that such exigent circumstances were present.\nCertiorari granted; 773 So. 2d 259, reversed and remanded.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPolice officers entered petitioner's home, where they arrested and searched him. The officers had neither an arrest warrant nor a search warrant. Without deciding whether exigent circumstances had been present, the Louisiana Court of Appeal concluded that the warrantless entry, arrest, and search did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the Federal Constitution because there had been probable cause to arrest petitioner. 00-0190 (La. App. 11/15/00), 773 So. 2d 259. The court's reasoning plainly violates our holding in Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 590 (1980), that \"[a]bsent exigent line at the entrance to the firm\" circumstances,\" the house ... may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.\" We thus grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse the Court of Appeal's conclusion that the officers' actions were lawful, absent exigent circumstances.*\n\n\n2\nOn an evening in March 1998, police officers observed petitioner's apartment based on an anonymous citizen complaint that drug sales were occurring there. After witnessing what appeared to be several drug purchases and allowing the buyers to leave the scene, the officers stopped one of the buyers on the street outside petitioner's residence. The officers later testified that \"[b]ecause the stop took place within a block of the apartment, [they] feared that evidence would be destroyed and ordered that the apartment be entered.\" 00-0190, at 2, 773 So. 2d, at 261. Thus, \"[t]hey immediately knocked on the door of the apartment, arrested the defendant, searched him thereto and discovered the cocaine and the money.\" Id., at 4, 773 So. 2d, at 263. Although the officers sought and obtained a search warrant while they detained petitioner in his home, they only obtained this warrant after they had entered his home, arrested him, frisked him, found a drug vial in his underwear, and observed contraband in plain view in the apartment.\n\n\n3\nBased on these events, petitioner was charged in a Louisiana court with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained by the police as a result of their warrantless entry, arrest, and search. After holding a suppression hearing, the trial court denied this motion. Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to 15 years at hard labor.\n\n\n4\nOn direct review to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, petitioner challenged the trial court's suppression ruling. He argued that the police were not justified in entering his home without a warrant absent exigent circumstances. The Court of Appeal acknowledged petitioner's argument: \"[Petitioner] makes a long argument that there were not exigent circumstances for entering the apartment without a warrant.\" Id., at 2, 773 So. 2d, at 261. The court, however, declined to decide whether exigent circumstances had been present, because \"the evidence required to prove that the defendant possessed cocaine with the intent to distribute, namely the cocaine and the money, was not found in the apartment, but on his person.\" Ibid. The court concluded that because \"[t]he officers had probable cause to arrest and properly searched the defendant incident thereto ... [, t]he trial court properly denied the motion to suppress.\" Id., at 4, 773 So. 2d, at 263.\n\n\n5\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court denied review by a vote of 4 to 3. In a written dissent, Chief Justice Calogero explained:\n\n\n6\n\"The Fourth Amendment to the United States constitution has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the home, and thus, the police need both probable cause to either arrest or search and exigent circumstances to justify a nonconsensual warrantless intrusion into private premises.... Here, the defendant was arrested inside an apartment, without a warrant, and the state has not demonstrated that exigent circumstances were present. Consequently, defendant's arrest was unconstitutional, and his motion to suppress should have been granted.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 1-2.\n\n\n7\nWe agree with Chief Justice Calogero that the Court of Appeal clearly erred by concluding that petitioner's arrest and the search \"incident thereto,\" 00-0190, at 4, 773 So. 2d, at 263, were constitutionally permissible. In Payton, we examined whether the Fourth Amendment was violated by a state statute that authorized officers to \"enter a private residence without a warrant and with force, if necessary, to make a routine felony arrest.\" 445 U. S., at 574. We determined that \"the reasons for upholding warrantless arrests in a public place do not apply to warrantless invasions of the privacy of the home.\" Id., at 576. We held that because \"the Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house ... [, a]bsent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.\" Id., at 590. And we noted that an arrest warrant founded on probable cause, as well as a search warrant, would suffice for entry. Id., at 603.\n\n\n8\nHere, the police had neither an arrest warrant for petitioner, nor a search warrant for petitioner's apartment, when they entered his home, arrested him, and searched him. The officers testified at the suppression hearing that the reason for their actions was a fear that evidence would be destroyed, but the Louisiana Court of Appeal did not determine that such exigent circumstances were present. Rather, the court, in respondent's own words, determined \"that the defendant's argument that there were no exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless entry of the apartment was irrelevant\" to the constitutionality of the officers' actions. Brief in Opposition 2-3. As Payton makes plain, police officers need either a warrant or probable cause plus exigent circumstances in order to make a lawful entry into a home. The Court of Appeal's ruling to the contrary, and consequent failure to assess whether exigent circumstances were present in this case, violated Payton.\n\n\n9\nPetitioner and respondent both dispute at length whether exigent circumstances were, in fact, present.

C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.PAULA L. BUFORD, PETITIONERv.UNITED STATES\nNo. 99-9073.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nArgued January 8, 2001\nDecided March 20, 2001\n\nSyllabus\nThe United States Sentencing Guidelines, as relevant here, define a career offender as one with at least two prior felony convictions for violent or drug-related crimes and provide that a sentencing judge must count as a single prior conviction all \"related\" convictions, advising that they are \"related\" when, inter alia, they were consolidated for sentencing. The Seventh Circuit has held that because two prior convictions might have been consolidated for sentencing, and hence related, even if a sentencing court did not enter a formal consolidation order, a court should decide whether such convictions were nonetheless functionally consolidated, meaning that they were factually or logically related and sentencing was joint. Petitioner Buford pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery. At sentencing, the Government conceded that her four prior robbery convictions were related, but did not concede that her prior drug conviction was related to the robberies. The District Court decided that the drug and robbery cases had not been consolidated, either formally or functionally, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, reviewing the District Court's decision deferentially rather than de novo.\nHeld: Deferential review is appropriate when an appeals court reviews a trial court's Sentencing Guideline determination as to whether an offender's prior convictions were consolidated for sentencing. The relevant federal sentencing statute requires a reviewing court not only to \"accept\" a district court's \"findings of fact\" (unless \"clearly erroneous\"), but also to \"give due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" 18 U.S.C.  3742(e) (emphasis added). The \"deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented.\" Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98. Although Buford argues that the nature of the question here-applying a Guideline term to undisputed facts-demands no deference at all, the district court is in a better position than the appellate court to decide whether individual circumstances demonstrate functional consolidation. Experience with trials, sentencing, and consolidation procedures will help a district judge draw the proper inferences from the procedural descriptions provided. In addition, factual nuance may closely guide the legal decision, with legal results depending heavily upon an understanding of the significance of case-specific details. And the decision's fact-bound nature limits the value of appellate court precedent, which may provide only minimal help when other courts consider other procedural circumstances, state systems, and crimes. Insofar as greater uniformity is necessary, the Sentencing Commission can provide it. Pp. 4-7.\n201 F.3d 937, affirmed.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\nBreyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nOpinion of the Court\nJustice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case raises a narrow question of sentencing law. What standard of review applies when a court of appeals reviews a trial court's Sentencing Guideline determination as to whether an offender's prior convictions were consolidated, hence \"related,\" for purposes of sentencing? In particular, should the appeals court review the trial court's decision deferentially or de novo? We conclude, as did the Court of Appeals, that deferential review is appropriate, and we affirm.\n\n\n2\n* A\n\n\n3\nThe trial court decision at issue focused on one aspect of the United States Sentencing Guidelines' treatment of \"career offenders,\" a category of offender subject to particularly severe punishment. The Guidelines define a \"career offender\" as an offender with \"at least two prior felony convictions\" for violent or drug-related crimes. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 4B1.1 (Nov. 2000) (USSG). At the same time, they provide that a sentencing judge must count as a single prior felony conviction all those that are \"related\" to one another. USSG 4B1.2(c), and comment., n. 3; 4A1.2(a)(2). And they advise (in an application note) that prior convictions are \"related\" to one another when, inter alia, they \"were consolidated for . . . sentencing.\" 4A1.2, comment., n. 3.\n\n\n4\nThe Seventh Circuit has refined this \"prior conviction\" doctrine yet further. It has held that two prior convictions might have been \"consolidated for sentencing,\" and hence \"related,\" even if the sentencing court did not enter any formal order of consolidation. See United States v. Joseph, 50 F.3d 401, 404, cert. denied, 516 U. S 847 (1995). In such an instance, the Circuit has said, a court should decide whether the convictions were nonetheless \"functionally consolidated,\" which means that the convictions were \"factually or logically related, and sentencing was joint.\" 201 F.3d 937, 940 (2000) (emphasis added).\n\nB\n\n5\nThis case concerns \"functional consolidation.\" Paula Buford pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery, a crime of violence, in federal court. The federal sentencing judge had to decide whether Buford's five 1992 Wisconsin state-court convictions were \"related\" to one another, and consequently counted as one single prior conviction, or whether they should count as more than one.\n\n\n6\nThe Government conceded that four of the five prior convictions were \"related\" to one another. These four involved a series of gas station robberies. All four had been the subject of a single criminal indictment, and Buford had pleaded guilty to all four at the same time in the same court. See USSG 4A1.2, comment., n. 3 (prior offenses are \"related\" if \"consolidated for trial or sentencing\").\n\n\n7\nThe Government did not concede, however, that the fifth conviction, for a drug crime, was \"related\" to the other four. The drug crime (possession of, with intent to deliver, cocaine) had taken place about the same time as the fourth robbery, and Buford claimed that the robberies had been motivated by her drug addiction. But the only evidentiary link among the crimes was that the police had discovered the cocaine when searching Buford's house after her arrest for the robberies. Moreover, no formal order of consolidation had been entered. The State had charged the drug offense in a separate indictment and had assigned a different prosecutor to handle the drug case. A different judge had heard Buford plead guilty to the drug charge in a different hearing held on a different date; two different state prosecutors had appeared before the sentencing court, one discussing drugs, the other discussing the robberies; and the sentencing court had entered two separate judgments.\n\n\n8\nBuford, without denying these facts, nonetheless pointed to other circumstances that, in her view, showed that the drug crime conviction had been \"consolidated\" with the robbery convictions for sentencing, rendering her drug conviction and robbery convictions \"related.\" She pointed out that the State had sent the four robbery cases for sentencing to the very same judge who had heard and accepted her plea of guilty to the drug charge; that the judge had heard arguments about sentencing in all five cases at the same time in a single proceeding; that the judge had issued sentences for all five crimes at the same time; and that the judge, having imposed three sentences for the five crimes (6 years for the drug crime, 12 years for two robberies, and 15 years for the other two), had ordered all three to run concurrently.\n\n\n9\nThe District Court, placing greater weight on the former circumstances than on the latter, decided that the drug case and the robbery cases had not been consolidated for sentencing, either formally or functionally. Buford appealed. The Court of Appeals found the \"functional consolidation\" question a close one, and wrote that \"the standard of appellate review may be dispositive.\" 201 F.3d, at 940. It decided to review the District Court's decision \"deferentially\" rather than \"de novo.\" Id., at 942. And it affirmed that decision. Ibid.\n\n\n10\nBuford sought certiorari. In light of the different Circuits' different approaches to the problem, we granted the writ. Compare United States v. Irons, 196 F.3d 634, 638 (CA6 1999) (relatedness decision reviewed for clear error); United States v. Wiseman, 172 F.3d 1196, 1219 (CA10) (same), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 889 (1999); United States v. Mapp, 170 F.3d 328, 338 (CA2) (same), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 901 (1999); United States v. Maza, 93 F.3d 1390, 1400 (CA8 1996) (same), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1138 (1997); United States v. Mullens, 65 F.3d 1560, 1565 (CA11 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1112 (1996) (same), with United States v. Garcia, 962 F.2d 479, 481 (CA5) (relatedness determination reviewed de novo), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 902 (1992); United States v. Davis, 922 F.2d 1385, 1388 (CA9 1991) (same).\n\nII\n\n11\nIn arguing for de novo review, Buford points out that she has not contested any relevant underlying issue of fact. She disagrees only with the District Court's legal conclusion that a legal label-\"functional consolidation\"-failed to fit the undisputed facts. She concedes, as she must, that this circumstance does not dispose of the standard of review question. That is because the relevant federal sentencing statute requires a reviewing court not only to \"accept\" a district court's \"findings of fact\" (unless \"clearly erroneous\"), but also to \"give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" 18 U.S.C.  3742(e) (emphasis added). And that is the kind of determination-application of the Guidelines to the facts-that is at issue here. Hence the question we must answer is what kind of \"deference\" is \"due.\" And, as we noted in Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98 (1996), the \"deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented.\"\n\n\n12\nBuford argues that the nature of the question presented here-applying a Sentencing Guidelines term to undisputed facts-demands no deference at all. That is to say, the deference \"due\" is no deference; hence the Court of Appeals should have reviewed the trial court's decision de novo. Buford points out that, because the underlying facts are not in dispute, witness credibility is not important. She adds that de novo appellate review will help clarify and make meaningful the consolidation-related legal principles at issue. And she says that de novo review will help avoid inconsistent trial court determinations about consolidation, thereby furthering the Guidelines' effort to bring consistency to sentencing law.\n\n\n13\nDespite these arguments, we believe that the appellate court was right to review this trial court decision deferentially rather than de novo. In Koon, we based our selection of an abuse-of-discretion standard of review on the relative institutional advantages enjoyed by the district court in making the type of determination at issue. See id., at 98-99; cf. Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 114 (1985) (deference may depend on whether \"one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question\"). We concluded there that the special competence of the district court helped to make deferential review appropriate. And that is true here as well. That is to say, the district court is in a better position than the appellate court to decide whether a particular set of individual circumstances demonstrates \"functional consolidation.\"\n\n\n14\nThat is so because a district judge sees many more \"consolidations\" than does an appellate judge. As a trial judge, a district judge is likely to be more familiar with trial and sentencing practices in general, including consolidation procedures. And as a sentencing judge who must regularly review and classify defendants' criminal histories, a district judge is more likely to be aware of which procedures the relevant state or federal courts typically follow. Experience with trials, sentencing, and consolidations will help that judge draw the proper inferences from the procedural descriptions provided.\n\n\n15\nIn addition, factual nuance may closely guide the legal decision, with legal results depending heavily upon an understanding of the significance of case-specific details. See Koon v. United States, supra, at 98-99 (District Court's detailed understanding of the case before it and experience with other sentencing cases favored deferential review); Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 403-404 (1990) (fact-intensive nature of decision whether to impose sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 made deferential review appropriate); Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 560 (1988) (District Court's familiarity with facts of case warranted deferential review of determination whether Government's legal position was \"substantially justified\"). In a case like this one, for example, under Seventh Circuit doctrine, the District Judge usefully might have considered the factual details of the crimes at issue in order to determine whether factual connections among those crimes, rather than, say, administrative convenience, led Wisconsin to sentence Buford simultaneously and concurrently for the robbery and drug offenses. See United States v. Joseph, 50 F.3d, at 404; United States v. Russell, 2 F.3d 200, 204 (CA7 1993).\n\n\n16\nNor can we place determinative weight upon the heightened uniformity benefits that Buford contends will result from de novo review. The legal question at issue is a minor, detailed, interstitial question of sentencing law, buried in a judicial interpretation of an application note to a Sentencing Guideline. That question is not a generally recurring, purely legal matter, such as interpreting a set of legal words, say, those of an individual guideline, in order to determine their basic intent. Nor is that question readily resolved by reference to general legal principles and standards alone. Rather, the question at issue grows out of, and is bounded by, case-specific detailed factual circumstances. And the fact-bound nature of the decision limits the value of appellate court precedent, which may provide only minimal help when other courts consider other procedural circumstances, other state systems, and other crimes. In any event, the Sentencing Commission itself gathers information on the sentences imposed by different courts, it views the sentencing process as a whole, it has developed a broad perspective on sentencing practices throughout the Nation, and it can, by adjusting the Guidelines or the application notes, produce more consistent sentencing results among similarly situated offenders sentenced by different courts. Insofar as greater uniformity is necessary, the Commission can provide it. Cf. Braxton v. United States, 500 U.S. 344, 347-348 (1991) (Congress intended Sentencing Commission to play primary role in resolving conflicts over interpretation of Guidelines).\n\nIII\n\n17\nIn light of the fact-bound nature of the legal decision, the comparatively greater expertise of the District Court, and the limited value of uniform court of appeals precedent, we conclude that the Court of Appeals properly reviewed the District Court's \"functional consolidation\" decision deferentially.

Decided February 21, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  State and federal courts must enforce the Federal Arbi-\ntration Act (FAA), 9 U.S. C. §1 et seq., with respect to all\narbitration agreements covered by that statute. Here, the\nSupreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, by misreading\nand disregarding the precedents of this Court interpreting\nthe FAA, did not follow controlling federal law implement-\ning that basic principle. The state court held unenforce-\nable all predispute arbitration agreements that apply to\nclaims alleging personal injury or wrongful death against\nnursing homes.\n  The decision of the state court found the FAA’s coverage\nto be more limited than mandated by this Court’s previous\ncases. The decision of the State Supreme Court of Appeals\nmust be vacated. When this Court has fulfilled its duty to\ninterpret federal law, a state court may not contradict or\nfail to implement the rule so established. See U. S. Const.,\nArt. VI, cl. 2.\n2        MARMET HEALTH CARE CENTER v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n\n                              I\n\n   This litigation involves three negligence suits against\nnursing homes in West Virginia. The suits were brought\nby Clayton Brown, Jeffrey Taylor, and Sharon Marchio.\nIn each case, a family member of a patient requiring ex-\ntensive nursing care had signed an agreement with a\nnursing home on behalf of the patient. The relevant parts\nof the agreements in Brown’s case and Taylor’s case were\nidentical. The contracts included a clause requiring the\nparties to arbitrate all disputes, other than claims to col-\nlect late payments owed by the patient. The contracts\nincluded a provision holding the party filing the arbitra-\ntion responsible for paying a filing fee in accordance with\nthe Rules of the American Arbitration Association fee\nschedules. The agreement in Marchio’s case also included\na clause requiring arbitration but made no exceptions to\nthe arbitration requirement and did not mention filing\nfees.\n   In each of the three cases, a family member of a patient\nwho had died sued the nursing home in state court, alleg-\ning that negligence caused injuries or harm resulting in\ndeath. A state trial court dismissed the suits by Brown\nand Taylor based on the agreements to arbitrate. The\nSupreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia consolidated\nthose cases with Marchio’s, which was before the court on\nother issues.\n   In a decision concerning all three cases, the state court\nheld that “as a matter of public policy under West Virginia\nlaw, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission\nagreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence\nthat results in a personal injury or wrongful death, shall\nnot be enforced to compel arbitration of a dispute concern-\ning the negligence.” Brown v. Genesis Healthcare Corp.,\nNo. 35494 (W. Va., June 29, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 11–391, pp. 85a–86a (hereinafter Pet. App.). The\nstate court considered whether the state public policy was\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\npre-empted by the FAA. The state court found unpersua-\nsive this Court’s interpretation of the FAA, calling it “ten-\ndentious,” id., at 51a, and “created from whole cloth,” id.,\nat 53a. It later concluded that “Congress did not intend\nfor the FAA to be, in any way, applicable to personal\ninjury or wrongful death suits that only collaterally derive\nfrom a written agreement that evidences a transaction\naffecting interstate commerce, particularly where the\nagreement involves a service that is a practical necessity\nfor members of the public,” id., at 84a. The court thus\nconcluded that the FAA does not pre-empt the state pub-\nlic policy against predispute arbitration agreements that\napply to claims of personal injury or wrongful death\nagainst nursing homes.\n    The West Virginia court’s interpretation of the FAA was\nboth incorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in\nthe precedents of this Court. The FAA provides that a\n“written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transac-\ntion involving commerce to settle by arbitration a contro-\nversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction\n. . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.” 9 U.S. C. §2. The statute’s text includes\nno exception for personal-injury or wrongful-death claims.\nIt “requires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to\narbitrate.” Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S.\n213, 217 (1985). It “reflects an emphatic federal policy in\nfavor of arbitral dispute resolution.” KPMG LLP v. Coc-\nchi, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3)\n(quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 631 (1985); internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n    As this Court reaffirmed last Term, “[w]hen state law\nprohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of\nclaim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule\nis displaced by the FAA.” AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concep-\n4        MARMET HEALTH CARE CENTER v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncion, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6–7). That rule\nresolves these cases. West Virginia’s prohibition against\npredispute agreements to arbitrate personal-injury or\nwrongful-death claims against nursing homes is a cate-\ngorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of\nclaim, and that rule is contrary to the terms and coverage\nof the FAA. See ibid. See also, e.g., Preston v. Ferrer, 552\nU.S. 346, 356 (2008) (FAA pre-empts state law granting\nstate commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide issue\nthe parties agreed to arbitrate); Mastrobuono v.

Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 10\n(1984) (FAA pre-empts state financial investment statute’s\nprohibition of arbitration of claims brought under that\nstatute).\n                               II\n   The West Virginia court proposed an “alternativ[e]” hold-\ning that the particular arbitration clauses in Brown’s\ncase and Taylor’s case were unconscionable. Pet. App.\n89a–91a, 94a. See also id., at 98a (not addressing the\nquestion whether the arbitration agreement in Marchio’s\ncase is unenforceable for reasons other than public policy).\nIt is unclear, however, to what degree the state court’s\nalternative holding was influenced by the invalid, categor-\nical rule discussed above, the rule against predispute\narbitration agreements. For example, in its discussion of\nthe alternative holding, the state court found the arbitra-\ntion clauses unconscionable in part because a predispute\narbitration agreement that applies to claims of personal\ninjury or wrongful death against nursing homes “clearly\nviolates public policy.” Id., at 91a.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

GINSBURG, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which SOUTER and BREYER, JJ., joined.\nJUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364 (1994), this Court held that a state prisoner's claim for damages is not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 if \"a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\" unless the prisoner can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has previously been invalidated. This case presents the question whether a claim for damages and declaratory relief brought by a state prisoner challenging the validity of the procedures used to deprive him of good-time credits is cognizable under § 1983.\n\n\n2\nRespondent Jerry Balisok is an inmate at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. On August  16, 1993, he was charged with, and at a hearing on September 2 was found guilty of, four prison infractions. He was sentenced to 10 days in isolation, 20 days in segregation, and deprivation of 30 days' good-time credit he had previously earned toward his release. His appeal within the prison's appeal system was rejected for failure to comply with the applicable procedural requirements.\n\n\n3\nOn January 26, 1994, respondent filed the present § 1983 action alleging that the procedures used in his disciplinary proceeding violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. His amended complaint requested a declaration that the procedures employed by state officials violated due process, compensatory and punitive damages for use of the unconstitutional procedures, an injunction to prevent future violations, and any other relief the court deems just and equitable. Taking account of our opinion in Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827 (1973), which held that the sole remedy in federal court for a prisoner seeking restoration of good-time credits is a writ of habeas corpus, Balisok's amended complaint did not request restoration of the lost credits. (As the District Court noted,  however, he expressly reserved the right to seek that relief in an appropriate forum. App. to Pet. for Cert. F-4.)\n\n\n4\nThe District Court, applying our opinion in Heck, held that a judgment in Balisok's favor \"would necessarily imply the invalidity of the disciplinary hearing and the resulting sanctions.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. F-14. Rather than grant petitioners' motion to dismiss, however, the District Court stayed this action pending filing and resolution of a state-court action for restoration of the good-time credits. It authorized an immediate appeal of its ruling pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that a claim challenging only the procedures employed in a disciplinary hearing is always cognizable under § 1983. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2. We granted certiorari. 517 U.S.    , 116 S. Ct. 1564, 134 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1996).\n\n\n5\nThe violations of due process alleged by respondent are similar to those alleged by the plaintiff in Heck. There, the allegations were that the state officials had conducted an arbitrary investigation, had knowingly destroyed exculpatory evidence, and had caused an illegal voice identification procedure to be used at the plaintiff's  criminal trial. 512 U.S. at 479. Here, respondent principally alleged that petitioner Edwards, who was the hearing officer at his disciplinary proceeding, concealed exculpatory witness statements and refused to ask specified questions of requested witnesses, App. to Pet. for Cert. I-3 to I-7, which prevented respondent from introducing extant exculpatory material and \"intentionally denied\" him the right to present evidence in his defense, Brief for Respondent 3. (Respondent also alleged that Edwards failed to provide a statement of the facts supporting the guilty finding against him, App. to Pet. for Cert. I-6 to I-7, and that petitioner Wood erroneously rejected his appeal as exceeding the page limitation, id., at I-7 to I-8.)\n\n\n6\nThere is, however, this critical difference from Heck: Respondent, in his amended complaint, limited his request to damages for depriving him of good-time credits without due process, not for depriving him of good-time credits undeservedly as a substantive matter. * That is to say, his claim posited that the procedures were wrong, but not necessarily that the result was. The distinction between these two sorts of claims is clearly established  in our case law, as is the plaintiff's entitlement to recover at least nominal damages under § 1983 if he proves the former one without also proving the latter one. See Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266-267, 55 L. Ed. 2d 252, 98 S. Ct. 1042 (1978). The Court of Appeals was of the view that this difference from Heck was dispositive, following Circuit precedent to the effect that a claim challenging only the procedures employed in a disciplinary hearing is always cognizable under § 1983. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2, citing Gotcher v. Wood, 66 F.3d 1097, 1099 (CA9 1995), cert. pending, No. 95-1385.\n\n\n7\nThat principle is incorrect, since it disregards the possibility, clearly envisioned by Heck, that the nature of the challenge to the procedures could be such as necessarily to imply the invalidity of the judgment. This possibility is alluded to in  the very passage from Heck relied upon by the Court of Appeals, a passage that distinguished the earlier case of Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963 (1974), as follows:\"In light of the earlier language characterizing the claim as one of 'damages for the deprivation of civil rights,' rather than damages for the deprivation of good-time credits, we think this passage recognized a § 1983 claim for using the wrong procedures, not for reaching the wrong result (i.e., denying good-time credits). Nor is there any indication in the opinion, or any reason to believe, that using the wrong procedures necessarily vitiated the denial of good-time credits. Thus, the claim at issue in Wolff did not call into question the lawfulness of the plaintiff's continuing confinement.\" Heck, supra, at 482-483 (emphasis added).The same point was apparent in Heck's summary of its holding:\n\n\n8\n\"We hold that, in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,6 a § 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been [overturned].\"  512 U.S. at 486-487 (emphasis added).The footnote appended to the above-italicized clause gave a concrete example of \"a § 1983 action that does not seek damages directly attributable to conviction or confinement but whose successful prosecution would necessarily imply that the plaintiff's criminal conviction was wrongful.\" Id., at 486, n.6. The Court of Appeals was thus incorrect in asserting that a claim seeking damages only \"for using the wrong procedure, not for reaching the wrong result,\" Gotcher, supra, at 1099, would never be subject to the limitation announced in Heck.\n\n\n9\nThe principal procedural defect complained of by respondent would, if established, necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of his good-time credits. His claim is, first of all, that he was completely denied the opportunity to put on a defense through specifically identified witnesses who possessed exculpatory evidence. It appears that all witness testimony in his defense was excluded. See App. to Pet. for Cert. F-2 (District Court opinion) (\"At the infraction hearing . . ., [respondent] asked that the witness statements be read into the record. According to [respondent],  Edwards replied that no witness statements had been submitted on his behalf\"). This is an obvious procedural defect, and state and federal courts have reinstated good-time credits (absent a new hearing) when it is established. See, e.g., Kingsley v. Bureau of Prisons, 937 F.2d 26, 27, 31 (CA2 1991); Dumas v. State, 654 So. 2d 48, 49 (Ala. Crim. App. 1994); Mahers v. State, 437 N.W.2d 565, 568-569 (Iowa 1989); In re Contras, 199 A.D.2d 601, 602, 604 N.Y.S.2d 651, 652 (1993). Cf. In re Reismiller, 101 Wash. 2d 291, 293-297, 678 P.2d 323, 325, 326 (1984); In re Burton, 80 Wash. App. 573, 585, 910 P.2d 1295, 1304 (1996). Respondent's claim, however, goes even further, asserting that the cause of the exclusion of the exculpatory evidence was the deceit and bias of the hearing officer himself. He contends that the hearing officer lied about the nonexistence of witness statements, see App. to Pet. for Cert. I-4, I-6, I-7; Brief for Respondent 2-3; App. 4, and thus \"intentionally denied\" him the right to present the extant exculpatory evidence, Brief for Respondent 3. A criminal defendant tried by a partial judge is entitled to have his conviction  set aside, no matter how strong the evidence against him. Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 535, 71 L. Ed. 749, 47 S. Ct. 437 (1927); Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 308, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302, 111 S. Ct. 1246 (1991). The due process requirements for a prison disciplinary hearing are in many respects less demanding than those for criminal prosecution, but they are not so lax as to let stand the decision of a biased hearing officer who dishonestly suppresses evidence of innocence. Cf. Wolff, supra, at 570-571.\n\n\n10\nRespondent contends that a judgment in his favor would not imply the invalidity of the loss of his good-time credits because Washington courts follow a \"some or any evidence\" standard, under which, \"if there is any evidence in the record to support the prison hearing determination, then the court will not undertake an entire review of the record and will uphold prison hearing results.\" Brief for Respondent 7, citing Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 105 S. Ct. 2768, 86 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1985); Brief for Respondent 21 (citing Washington state cases). Here, respondent points out, the record contains ample evidence to support the judgment under this standard. That may be true, but when the basis for attacking  the judgment is not insufficiency of the evidence, it is irrelevant. As the Washington Supreme Court has explained: \"The evidentiary requirements of due process are satisfied if there is 'some evidence' in the record to support a prison disciplinary decision revoking good time credits.\" In re Johnston, 109 Wash. 2d 493, 497, 745 P.2d 864, 867 (1987) (emphasis added). Similarly, our discussion in Hill in no way abrogated the due process requirements enunciated in Wolff, but simply held that in addition to those requirements, revocation of good-time credits does not comport with \"'the minimum requirements of procedural due process,'\" unless the findings are \"supported by some evidence in the record.\" 472 U.S. at 454 (quoting Wolff, supra, at 558).\n\n\n11\nWe conclude, therefore, that respondent's claim for declaratory relief and money damages, based on allegations of deceit and bias on the part of the decisionmaker that necessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed, is not cognizable under § 1983. Respondent also requests, however, prospective injunctive relief. His amended complaint alleges that prison officials routinely fail to date-stamp witness statements  that are made in cases involving \"jail house attorneys\" like himself, in order to weaken any due-process challenge for failure to call witnesses. App. to Pet. for Cert. I-4. He requests an injunction requiring prison officials to date-stamp witness statements at the time they are received. Id., at I-10. Ordinarily, a prayer for such prospective relief will not \"necessarily imply\" the invalidity of a previous loss of good-time credits, and so may properly be brought under § 1983. To prevail, of course, respondent must establish standing, see Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S.    ,    , 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996), and meet the usual requirements for injunctive relief, see, e.g., O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 499, 502, 38 L. Ed. 2d 674, 94 S. Ct. 669 (1974). Neither the Ninth Circuit nor the District Court considered this injunctive claim, and its validity was neither briefed nor argued here. We leave this issue for consideration by the lower courts on remand.\n\n\n12\nSince we are remanding, we must add a word concerning the District Court's decision to stay this § 1983 action while respondent sought restoration of his good-time credits, rather than dismiss it. The District Court was of the view that once respondent  had exhausted his state remedies, the § 1983 action could proceed. App. to Pet. for Cert. F-14. This was error. We reemphasize that § 1983 contains no judicially imposed exhaustion requirement, Heck, 512 U.S. at 481, 483; absent some other bar to the suit, a claim either is cognizable under § 1983 and should immediately go forward, or is not cognizable and should be dismissed.\n\n\n13\nThe judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n14\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n15\nJUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring.\n\n\n16\nI agree that Balisok's claim is not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to the extent that it is \"based on allegations of deceit and bias on the part of the decisionmaker,\" ante, at 6; those allegations, as the Court explains, \"necessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed,\" ante, at 7; see ante, at 5-6. Balisok alleged other procedural defects, however, including the failure of prison official Edwards \"to specify what facts and evidence supported the finding of guilt.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. F-3 (District Court order); see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 564-565, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963 (1974) (inmate subjected to discipline is entitled to a written statement of reasons and evidence relied on). A defect of this order, unlike the principal \"deceit and bias\" procedural defect Balisok alleged, see ante, at 5, would not necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of his good-time credits, and therefore is immediately cognizable under § 1983. On this understanding, I join the Court's opinion.\n\n\n17\n-------------- Footnotes --------------\n\n\n18\n* The amended complaint could be considered ambiguous on the point, but this was the Court of Appeals' interpretation, which has been accepted by petitioners.

The District Court dismissed petitioner's claims alleging violation of her due process rights and a conspiracy to violate her due process rights under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and 42 U.S.C. §1985, respectively.  The claims, which arose out of a dispute with her landlord, were based on purported \"sewer service'' used by her landlord's lawyers and acceptance of the affidavits of service by the state court trial judge.  The Second Circuit denied petitioner's motion to proceed in forma pauperis and dismissed her appeal as frivolous.\n\n\n2\nWe deny petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis. She is allowed until March 30, 1998, to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit her petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.  For the reasons discussed below, we also direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further petitions for certiorari in noncriminal matters from petitioner unless she first pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits her  petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner has filed 14 petitions with this Court since 1994. All have been denied without recorded dissent.  In 1997, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny petitioner in forma pauperis status. Glendora v. DiPaola, 522 U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 410, 139 L.Ed.2d 313 (1997).  Petitioner nevertheless has filed another frivolous petition with this Court.  In her petition, Glendora asserts that the state trial court judge who presided over her dispute with her landlord sanctioned \"sewer service'' by her landlord's lawyers, and that the District Court and Court of Appeals sanctioned this conduct.  She does not address the District Court's reasons for dismissing her complaint.\n\n\n4\nAccordingly, we enter this order barring prospective in forma pauperis filings by petitioner in noncriminal cases for the reasons discussed in Martin v.

On direct appeal, the State Court of Appeal rejected his claim that the trial judge coerced his deadlocked jury into continuing deliberations. The Federal District Court dismissed respondent's subsequent federal habeas petition but granted a certificate of appealability on the question whether the state trial judge violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights by coercing the jury into rendering a verdict. The Ninth Circuit reversed on that ground and instructed the District Court to grant the writ.\nHeld: The Ninth Circuit's decision exceeds the limits imposed on federal habeas review by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), which forecloses habeas relief on any claim adjudicated on the merits in state-court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that (1) was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceedings. The Ninth Circuit erred in believing that a state court's \"failure to cite\" controlling Supreme Court precedent renders its decision \"contrary to\" clearly established federal law. Awareness of this Court's cases is not even required, so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them. The Ninth Circuit also erred in charging that the Court of Appeal did not apply the totality-of-the-circumstances test required by Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231. Finally, the Ninth Circuit erred in finding our holdings in Jenkins v. United States, 380 U.S. 445 (per curiam), and United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, which were based on the Court's supervisory power over the federal courts and not on constitutional grounds, applicable to state-court proceedings. Because the Ninth Circuit erroneously found that the State Court of Appeal's decision was contrary to clearly established Supreme Court law, and because it is at least reasonable to conclude that there was no jury coercion here, the State Court of Appeal's determination to that effect must stand.\nCertiorari granted; 291 F.3d 569, reversed.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted habeas relief to respondent William Packer after concluding that the state trial judge coerced the jury's verdict. Packer v. Hill, 291 F.3d 569 (2002). Because this decision exceeds the limits imposed on federal habeas review by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.\n\n\n2\n* A California jury convicted respondent of one count of second-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of attempted robbery, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and one count of assault with a firearm. It acquitted him on 10 other counts.\n\n\n3\nThe path to the jury's guilty verdicts on the murder and attempted-murder charges was not an easy one. After 28 hours of deliberation, and after the jury had returned sealed verdict forms on all the other charges, juror Eve Radcliff sent a note to the judge requesting to be dismissed from the jury due to \"`health problems.'\" 291 F. 3d, at 573. The judge then met alone with Radcliff, who explained that \"`because of the seriousness of the charges, I can't make snap decisions.... I was beginning to feel a little burned out.'\" Ibid. The judge asked Radcliff if she could \"`hold out just a little bit longer,'\" and when Radcliff agreed the judge replied: \"`I really appreciate it. Otherwise, they have to start deliberations all over again with another person.'\" Ibid. (emphasis deleted).\n\n\n4\nThe next day, the foreman sent the judge a note stating that \"`we can no longer deliberate,'\" that \"`Eve Radcliff, does not appear to be able to understand the rules as given by you,'\" that \"`nearly all my fellow jurors questio[n] her ability to understand the rules and her ability to reason,'\" and that continuing will result in a \"`hung jury ... based on ... one person's inability to reason or desire to be unreasonable.'\" Ibid. The judge called the jury into the court-room, and, in the presence of the attorneys and the defendant, read the note aloud. The judge asked the foreman whether the jury was deliberating. The foreman replied that the jurors were \"`just having the same conversation over the same issue time and time again.'\" Id., at 574. The judge made the following statement to the jury:\n\n\n5\n\"`The juror has a right to do that, as you all know. They have a right to disagree with everybody else. But they do not have a right to not deliberate. They must deliberate and follow the rules and laws as I state it to them.'\" Ibid.\n\n\n6\nThe judge then asked the foreman what the latest vote count was, but told him not to reveal which side had which number of votes. The foreman indicated that the last vote count had been 11 to 1. After the foreman indicated that further deliberations would be helpful, the judge gave the following instruction to the jury:\n\n\n7\n\"`What you do is — like I think what the instructions were — you apply the facts to the law and you arrive at a decision. The law is right there, and I think elements of the law was [sic] given to you in those instructions. They do this or not do this? Was it proven beyond a reasonable doubt? This element, this element, this element? If they did and you find unanimously they did that, you must follow the law and find them either guilty or not guilty of that charge.'\" Ibid. (emphasis deleted).\n\n\n8\nAt this point, defense counsel objected on the ground that the judge was improperly \"`instructing the jury . . . as to their manner of deliberation.'\" Id., at 574-575. The judge overruled the objection and continued his instruction as follows:\n\n\n9\n\"`Ladies and Gentlemen, the only thing I'm going to tell you right now is; once again, I told you, you'll look up in the instructions paraphrasing it, I think I'm using the correct words: you're the sole judges of the facts. You determine the facts. You then apply the law to those facts as I state it to you, and you must accept and follow the law. You can't make up your own law. You must accept and follow the law as I state it to you.'\" Id., at 575.\n\n\n10\nThe judge then excused the jury for the day.\n\n\n11\nAfter a day off, deliberations resumed on a Friday. Once again, Radcliff sent the judge a note asking to be dismissed from the jury. This time she complained about \"`feeling[s] of distrust and disrespect from the other jurors,'\" and said that \"`I have reached a point of anger, and I don't believe I can be objective.'\" Ibid. The judge again met with Radcliff in his chambers, outside the presence of attorneys, and asked her if she was continuing to deliberate. Radcliff responded that she was \"trying,\" but not to the satisfaction of the others. Id., at 576. The judge thanked her and returned her to the jury room. Then the judge met briefly with the foreman, who assured him that Radcliff was indeed continuing to deliberate. The jury then resumed its deliberations. The following Tuesday, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the attempted-murder count, and the next morning a guilty verdict on the second-degree murder charge.\n\n\n12\nRespondent appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal for the State of California, Second Appellate District, arguing that the comments to Radcliff and to the jury were coercive and denied him his due process right to a fair and impartial jury. California law, unlike federal law, prohibits the giving of a so-called Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896), charge to a deadlocked jury — that is, a charge that specifically urges the minority jurors to give weight to the majority's views. People v. Gainer, 19 Cal.3d 835, 852, 566 P.2d 997, 1006 (1977), held that no instruction may be given which either \"(1) encourages jurors to consider the numerical division or preponderance of opinion of the jury in forming or reexamining their views on the issues before them; or (2) states or implies that if the jury fails to agree the case will necessarily be retried.\"\n\n\n13\nThe state appellate court, applying Gainer, rejected respondent's claim. \"[T]here is nothing improper,\" it said, \"in urging the jury to consider the matter further with the view to reaching an agreement[,] as long as the language used does not coerce a particular type of verdict. Accordingly, the comments made and not made by the court to the jury did not coerce a particular verdict or deny Packer any constitutional rights.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. H-15 to H-16 (citations omitted). The court rejected respondent's remaining challenges to his conviction, and the State Supreme Court declined review.\n\n\n14\nRespondent sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United States District Court for the Central District of California. That court dismissed the petition, but granted a certificate of appealability on the question whether the state trial judge violated respondent's Fourteenth Amendment rights by coercing the jury into rendering a verdict on the attempted-murder and second-degree murder counts. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed on that ground, and instructed the District Court to grant the writ on the murder convictions. California's Attorney General has petitioned for certiorari.\n\nII\n\n15\nWhen a habeas petitioner's claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state-court proceedings, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) forecloses relief unless the state court's adjudication of the claim:\n\n\n16\n\"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or \"(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"\n\n\n17\nThe jury-coercion claim in respondent's habeas petition is the same claim rejected on the merits in his direct appeal to the state appellate court, and the Ninth Circuit correctly recognized that § 2254(d) was therefore applicable. It held that respondent had established that the decision of the Court of Appeal was contrary to established federal law for two, and possibly three, reasons. We think none of them correct.\n\n\n18\nFirst, the Ninth Circuit observed that the state court \"failed to cite ... any federal law, much less the controlling Supreme Court precedents.\" 291 F.3d, at 578. If this meant to suggest that such citation was required, it was in error. A state-court decision is \"contrary to\" our clearly established precedents if it \"applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases\" or if it \"confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.\" Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405-406 (2000). Avoiding these pitfalls does not require citation of our cases — indeed, it does not even require awareness of our cases, so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them. The Ninth Circuit's disapproval of the Court of Appeal's failure to cite this Court's cases is especially puzzling since the state court cited instead decisions from the California Supreme Court that impose even greater restrictions for the avoidance of potentially coercive jury instructions. Compare People v. Gainer, supra, at 852, 566 P.2d, at 1006, with Allen v. United States, supra, at 501.\n\n\n19\nSecond, the Ninth Circuit charged that the Court of Appeal \"failed to apply the totality of the circumstances test as required by Lowenfield [v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988)].\" That was so, the Ninth Circuit concluded, because it \"simply mentioned three particular incidents in its analysis,\" \"failed to consider\" other \"critical facts,\" and \"failed to consider the cumulative impact\" of all the significant facts, one of which it \"[did] not even mention in its analysis.\" 291 F.3d, at 578-579, and n. 10. With regard to the last point: The significant fact the Ninth Circuit said was not mentioned — that the judge sent the jury back to its deliberations after learning that it was split 11 to 1 — was in fact succinctly described. See id., at 579, n. 10. The Court of Appeal focused its analysis upon \"three particular incidents\" for the entirely acceptable reason that (as the court said) those incidents constituted \"[t]he essence of Packer's complaints\" regarding juror coercion. App. to Pet. for Cert. H-15. The opinion set forth many facts and circumstances beyond those three incidents, including the two \"critical facts\" that the Ninth Circuit said it \"failed to consider,\" 291 F.3d, at 579, n. 10 — the judge's knowledge that Radcliff was the sole dissenting juror prior to his instructing the jury to keep deliberating, App. to Pet. for Cert. H-14, and the fact that the foreman's note, which mentioned Radcliff by name, was read in court, ibid. The contention that the California court \"failed to consider\" facts and circumstances that it had taken the trouble to recite strains credulity. The Ninth Circuit may be of the view that the Court of Appeal did not give certain facts and circumstances adequate weight (and hence adequate discussion); but to say that it did not consider them is an exaggeration. There is, moreover, nothing to support the Ninth Circuit's claim that the Court of Appeal did not consider the \"cumulative impact\" of all the recorded events. Compliance with Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988), does not demand a formulary statement that the trial court's actions and inactions were noncoercive \"individually and cumulatively.\" It suffices that that was the fair import of the Court of Appeal's opinion.\n\n\n20\nThird and last, the Ninth Circuit faulted the state appellate court for stating that \"`there is nothing improper in urging the jury to consider [the matter] further with the view to reaching an agreement as long as the language used does not coerce a particular type of verdict.'\" 291 F.3d, at 579. The Ninth Circuit found this statement to be \"contrary to\" both Jenkins v. United States, 380 U.S. 445 (1965) (per curiam), and United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422 (1978), which it construed to prohibit pressing the jurors to arrive at some verdict, not just \"`a particular type of verdict.'\" 291 F.3d, at 579. Neither Jenkins nor Gypsum Co. is relevant to the § 2254(d)(1) determination, since neither case sets forth a rule applicable to state-court proceedings. Jenkins and Gypsum Co. reversed convictions based on jury instructions given in federal prosecutions, and neither opinion purported to interpret any provision of the Constitution. That alone would be enough to defeat a claim that their application to state-court proceedings is \"clearly established.\" Lowenfield v. Phelps, supra, at 239, n. 2 (citation omitted), however, removed any lingering doubt regarding these cases' application to state convictions when it stated: \"[O]ur ruling in Jenkins v. United States was based on our supervisory power over the federal courts, and not on constitutional grounds. The Jenkins Court cited no provision of the Constitution, but rather relied upon other cases involving the exercise of supervisory powers.\" (The same was true of Gypsum Co.) Jenkins and Gypsum Co. are off the table as far as § 2254(d) is concerned, and the Ninth Circuit erred by relying on those nonconstitutional decisions.\n\n\n21\nHaving determined that the Court of Appeal \"failed to apply\" clearly established Supreme Court law, 291 F.3d, at 579 (a phrase which the opinion repeatedly and erroneously substitutes for the more demanding requirement of § 2254(d)(1): that the decision be \"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme Court law), the Ninth Circuit then proceeded to address the question \"whether [the Court of Appeal's] decision constituted error and if so whether the error had a substantial or injurious effect on the verdict.\" Ibid. But that inquiry would have been proper only if the Ninth Circuit had first found (pursuant to the correct standard) that the California court's decision was \"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme Court law — which it did not and could not. By mistakenly making the \"contrary to\" determination and then proceeding to a simple \"error\" inquiry, the Ninth Circuit evaded § 2254(d)'s requirement that decisions which are not \"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme Court law can be subjected to habeas relief only if they are not merely erroneous, but \"an unreasonable application\" of clearly established federal law, or based on \"an unreasonable determination of the facts\" (emphasis added). Even if we agreed with the Ninth Circuit majority (Judge Silverman dissented) that there was jury coercion here, it is at least reasonable to conclude that there was not, which means that the state court's determination to that effect must stand.\n\n\n22\n*   *   *\n\n\n23\nThe judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.\n\n\n24\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

YESKEY.\nNo. 97-634.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nArgued April 28, 1998.\nDecided June 15, 1998.\n\n\nSyllabus\n*\n\nRespondent Yeskey was sentenced to 18 to 36 months in a Pennsylvania correctional facility, but was recommended for placement in a Motivational Boot Camp for first-time offenders, the successful completion of which would have led to his parole in just six months.  When he was refused admission because of his medical history of hypertension, he sued petitioners, Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections and several officials, alleging that the exclusion violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Title II of which prohibits a \"public entity'' from discriminating against a \"qualified individual with a disability'' on account of that disability, 42 U.S.C. §12132.  The District Court dismissed for failure to state a claim, holding the ADA inapplicable to state prison inmates, but the Third Circuit reversed.\nHeld: State prisons fall squarely within Title II's statutory definition of \"public entity,'' which includes \"any  . . . instrumentality of a State  . . .  or local government.'' §12131(1)(B).  Unlike the situation that obtained in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410, there is no ambiguous exception that renders the coverage uncertain.  For that reason the plain-statement requirement articulated in Gregory, if applicable to federal intrusion upon the administration of state prisons, has been met.  Petitioners' attempts to derive an intent not to cover prisons from the statutory references to the \"benefits'' of programs, and to \"qualified individual'' are rejected; some prison programs, such as this one, have benefits and are restricted to qualified inmates.  The statute's lack of ambiguity also requires rejection of petitioners' appeal to the doctrine of constitutional doubt. The Court does not address the issue whether applying the ADA to state prisons is a constitutional exercise of Congress's power under either the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment because it was addressed by neither of the lower courts. Pp. ____-____.\n118 F.3d 168, affirmed.\nSCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nPaul A. Tufano, Harrisburg, PA, for petitioner.\nDonald Specter, Washington, DC, for respondent.\nIrving L. Gornstein, Washington, DC, for U.S. as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nJustice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe question before us is whether Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 337, 42 U.S.C. §12131 et seq., which prohibits a \"public entity'' from discriminating against a \"qualified individual with a disability'' on account of that individual's disability, see §12132, covers inmates in state prisons.  Respondent Ronald Yeskey was such an inmate, sentenced in May 1994 to serve 18 to 36 months in a Pennsylvania correctional facility.  The sentencing court recommended that he be placed in Pennsylvania's  Motivational Boot Camp for first-time offenders, the successful completion of which would have led to his release on parole in just six months.  See Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 61, §1121 et seq. (Purdon Supp.1998). Because of his medical history of hypertension, however, he was refused admission.  He filed this suit against petitioners, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections and several department officials, alleging that his exclusion from the Boot Camp violated the ADA.  The District Court dismissed for failure to state a claim, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6), holding the ADA inapplicable to inmates in state prisons; the Third Circuit reversed, 118 F.3d 168 (1997); we granted certiorari, 522 U.S.----, 118 S.Ct. 876, 139 L.Ed.2d 865 (1998).\n\n\n2\nPetitioners argue that state prisoners are not covered by the ADA for the same reason we held in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991), that state judges were not covered by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §621 et seq.  Gregory relied on the canon of construction that absent an \"unmistakably clear'' expression of intent to \"alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government,'' we will interpret a statute to preserve rather than destroy the States' \"substantial sovereign powers.'' 501 U.S., at 460-461, 111 S.Ct., at 2400-2401 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  It may well be that exercising ultimate control over the management of state prisons, like establishing the qualifications of state government officials, is a traditional and essential State function subject to the plain-statement rule of Gregory. \"One of the primary functions of government,'' we have said, \"is  the preservation of societal order through enforcement of the criminal law, and the maintenance of penal institutions is an essential part of that task.'' Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 412, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1811, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974), overruled on other grounds, Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 414, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 1882, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989). \"It is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger interest,'' Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 491, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1837, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).\n\n\n3\nAssuming, without deciding, that the plain-statement rule does govern application of the ADA to the administration of state prisons, we think the requirement of the rule is amply met: the statute's language unmistakeably includes State prisons and prisoners within its coverage.  The situation here is not comparable to that in Gregory. There, although the ADEA plainly covered state employees, it contained an exception for \"\"appointee[s] on the policymaking level''' which made it impossible for us to \"conclude that the statute plainly cover[ed] appointed state judges.'' 501 U.S., at 467, 111 S.Ct., at 2404. Here, the ADA plainly covers state institutions without any exception that could cast the coverage of prisons into doubt. Title II of the ADA provides that:\n\n\n4\n\"Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified      individual with a disability shall, by reason of such      disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied      the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a      public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such      entity.'' 42 U.S.C. §12132.\n\n\n5\nState prisons fall squarely within the statutory definition of \"public entity,'' which includes \"any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.'' §12131(1)(B).\n\n\n6\nPetitioners contend that the phrase \"benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity,'' §12132, creates an ambiguity, because state prisons do not provide prisoners with \"benefits'' of \"programs, services, or activities'' as those terms are ordinarily understood.  We disagree.  Modern prisons provide inmates with many recreational  \"activities,'' medical \"services,'' and educational and vocational \"programs,'' all of which at least theoretically \"benefit'' the prisoners (and any of which disabled prisoners could be \"excluded from participation in'').  See Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 580, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 3229-3230, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984) (referring to \"contact visitation program''); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 552, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3214, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (discussing \"rehabilitative programs and services''); Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 246, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 1745-1746, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983) (referring to \"appropriate correctional programs for all offenders'').  Indeed, the statute  establishing the Motivational Boot Camp at issue in this very case refers to it as a \"program.'' Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 61, §1123 (Purdon Supp.1998).  The text of the ADA provides no basis for distinguishing these programs, services, and activities from  those provided by public entities that are not prisons.\n\n\n7\nWe also disagree with petitioners' contention that the term \"qualified individual with a disability'' is ambiguous insofar as concerns its application to state prisoners.  The statute defines the term to include anyone with a disability\n\n\n8\n\"who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules,      policies, or practices, the removal of architectural,      communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision      of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential      eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the      participation in programs or activities provided by a public      entity.'' 42 U.S.C. §12131(2).\n\n\n9\nPetitioners argue that the words \"eligibility'' and \"participation'' imply voluntariness on the part of an applicant who seeks a benefit from the State, and thus do not connote prisoners who are being held against their will.  This is wrong on two counts: First, because the words do not connote voluntariness. See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 831 (2d ed. 1949) (\"eligible'': \"Fitted or qualified to be chosen or elected; legally or morally suitable; as, an eligible candidate''); id., at 1782 (\"participate'': \"To have a share in common with others; to partake; share, as in a debate'').  While  \"eligible'' individuals \"participate'' voluntarily in many programs, services, and activities, there are others for which they are \"eligible'' in which \"participation'' is mandatory.  A drug addict convicted of drug possession, for example, might, as  part of his sentence, be required to \"participate'' in a drug treatment program for which only addicts are \"eligible.''  And secondly, even if the words did connote voluntariness, it would still not be true that all prison \"services,'' \"programs,'' and \"activities'' are excluded from the Act because participation in  them is not voluntary.  The prison law library, for example, is a service (and the use of it an activity), which prisoners are free to take or leave.  Cf. Gabel v. Lynaugh, 835 F.2d 124, 125, n. 1  (C.A.5 1988) (per curiam) (\"pro se civil rights litigation has become a recreational activity for state prisoners'').  In the very case at hand, the governing law makes it clear that participation in the Boot Camp program is voluntary.  See Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 61, §1126(a) (Purdon Supp.1998) (\"An eligible inmate may make an application to the motivational boot camp selection committee for permission to participate in the motivational boot camp program''); §1126(c) (\" [c]onditio[n]'' of \"participa[tion]'' is that applicant \"agree to be bound by'' certain \"terms and conditions'').\n\n\n10\nFinally, petitioners point out that the statute's statement of findings and purpose, 42 U.S.C. §12101, does not mention prisons and prisoners.  That is perhaps questionable, since the provision's reference to discrimination \"in such critical areas as . . .  institutionalization,'' §12101(a)(3), can be thought to include penal institutions.  But assuming it to be true, and assuming further that it proves, as petitioners contend, that Congress did not \"envisio[n] that the ADA would be applied to state prisoners,'' Brief for Petitioners 13-14, in the context of an unambiguous statutory text that is irrelevant.  As we have said before, the fact that a statute can be \"\"applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth.''' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 499, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3286, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) (citation omitted).\n\n\n11\nOur conclusion that the text of the ADA is not ambiguous causes us also to reject petitioners' appeal to the doctrine of constitutional doubt, which requires that we interpret statutes to avoid \"grave and doubtful constitutional questions,'' United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408, 29 S.Ct. 527, 535-536, 53 L.Ed. 836 (1909).  That doctrine enters in only \"where a statute is susceptible of two constructions,'' ibid. And for the same reason we disregard petitioners' invocation of the statute's title, \"Public Services,'' 104 Stat. 337. \" [T]he title of a statute  . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.  For interpretive purposes, [it is] of use only when [it] shed[s] light on some ambiguous word or phrase.'' Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528-529, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 1392, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947).\n\n\n12\nWe do not address another issue presented by petitioners: whether application of the ADA to state prisons is a constitutional exercise of Congress's power under either the Commerce Clause, compare Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914 (1997), with Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985), or §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,  see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138  L.Ed.2d 624 (1997).  Petitioners raise this question in their brief, see Brief for Petitioner 22-23, but it was addressed by neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals, where petitioners raised only the Gregory plain-statement issue. \"Where issues are neither raised before nor considered by the Court of Appeals, this Court will not ordinarily consider them.''

STEVEN FRANK JACKSON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 10–797.   Decided March 21, 2011 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  A California jury convicted respondent Steven Frank\nJackson of numerous sexual offenses stemming from his\nattack on a 72-year-old woman who lived in his apartment\ncomplex. Jackson raised a Batson claim, asserting that\nthe prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to exclude\nblack prospective jurors on the basis of their race. See\nBatson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). Two of three\nblack jurors had been struck; the third served on the jury.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49–50.\n  Jackson’s counsel did not object when the prosecutor\nstruck the first of the black jurors, Juror S. Counsel later\nexplained that he did not make a “motion at that time”\nbecause he thought the excusal of Juror S “was a close\ncall.” After the prosecutor sought to dismiss the second\njuror, Juror J, Jackson’s counsel made the Batson motion\nchallenging both strikes. Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB\n(ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 7, pp. 76–77 (hereinaf\nter Document 7).\n  The prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for\nstriking each juror: Juror S had stated that from the ages\nof 16 to 30 years old, he was frequently stopped by Cali\nfornia police officers because—in his view—of his race and\nage. As the prosecutor put it, “Whether or not he still\nharbors any animosity is not something I wanted to roll\nthe dice with.” Id., at 78; Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB\n(ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 10, pp. 57–58, 98–100\n(hereinafter Document 10).\n  The prosecutor stated that he struck Juror J because\n2                   FELKNER v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nshe had a master’s degree in social work, and had interned\nat the county jail, “probably in the psych unit as a sociolo\ngist of some sort.” The prosecutor explained that he dis\nmissed her “based on her educational background,” stating\nthat he does not “like to keep social workers.” Document\n7, at 78–79; Document 10, at 188–189; App. to Pet. for\nCert. 49.\n   Jackson’s counsel expressly disagreed only with the\nprosecutor’s explanation for the strike of Juror J, see App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 22–23, 47, arguing that removing her on\nthe basis of her educational background was “itself invidi\nous discrimination.” The prosecutor responded that he\nwas not aware that social workers were a “protected\nclass.” As for Juror S, Jackson’s counsel explained that he\n“let [Juror S] slide” because he anticipated the prosecutor’s\nresponse and, in any event, he “only need[ed] one to estab\nlish the grounds for” a Batson motion. After listening to\neach side’s arguments, the trial court denied Jackson’s\nmotion. Document 7, at 78–80.\n   Jackson renewed his Batson claim on direct appeal,\narguing that a comparative juror analysis revealed that\nthe prosecutor’s explanations were pretextual.          With\nrespect to Juror S, Jackson argued that a non-black ju\nror—Juror 8—also had negative experiences with law\nenforcement but remained on the jury. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 47–48. Juror 8 stated during jury selection that he\nhad been stopped while driving in Illinois several years\nearlier as part of what he believed to be a “scam” by Illi\nnois police targeting drivers with California license plates.\nJuror 8 also complained that he had been disappointed by\nthe failure of law enforcement officers to investigate the\nburglary of his car. Document 10, at 26–27, 56–57, 95–97.\n   With respect to Juror J, Jackson claimed that the prose\ncutor asked follow-up questions of several white jurors\nwhen he was concerned about their educational back\ngrounds, but struck Juror J without asking her any ques\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

App. to Pet. for\nCert. 49.\n   The California Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s\ndenial of the Batson motion and affirmed Jackson’s convic\ntions. The appellate court explained that “[t]he trial\ncourt’s ruling on this issue is reviewed for substantial\nevidence,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), which the California courts have charac\nterized as equivalent to the “clear error” standard em\nployed by federal courts, see, e.g., People v. Alvarez, 14\nCal. 4th 155, 196, 926 P.2d 365, 389 (1996). With respect\nto whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were pretex\ntual, the court explained that it “give[s] great deference to\nthe trial court’s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons\nfrom sham excuses.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43.\n   After comparing Juror S to Juror 8, the court concluded\nthat “Juror 8’s negative experience out of state and the car\nburglary is not comparable to [Juror S’s] 14 years of per\nceived harassment by law enforcement based in part on\nrace.” Id., at 48. As for Juror J, the court recognized that\nthe prosecutor’s dismissal was based on her social services\nbackground—“a proper race-neutral reason”—and that\nthis explained his different treatment of jurors with\n“backgrounds in law, bio-chemistry or environmental\nengineering.” The court also noted that the “prosecutor\nfocused on [Juror J’s] internship experience” at the county\njail. Id., at 49.\n   After the California Supreme Court denied Jackson’s\npetition for review, Jackson sought federal habeas relief.\nThe Federal District Court properly recognized that re\nview of Jackson’s claim was governed by the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). That\nlaw provides, in pertinent part, that federal habeas relief\nmay not be granted unless the state court adjudication\n“resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence pre\n4                   FELKNER v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nsented in the State court proceeding.”          28 U.S. C.\n§2254(d)(2). After considering the state Court of Appeal\ndecision and reviewing the record evidence, the District\nCourt held that the California Court of Appeal’s findings\nwere not unreasonable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. The\nDistrict Court therefore denied Jackson’s petition.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in a\nthree-paragraph unpublished memorandum opinion. 389\nFed. Appx. 640 (2010). In so doing, the court did not\ndiscuss any specific facts or mention the reasoning of the\nother three courts that had rejected Jackson’s claim.\nInstead, after setting forth the basic background legal\nprinciples in the first two paragraphs, the Court of Ap\npeals offered a one-sentence conclusory explanation for its\ndecision:\n       “The prosecutor’s proffered race-neutral bases for\n    peremptorily striking the two African-American jurors\n    were not sufficient to counter the evidence of purpose\n    ful discrimination in light of the fact that two out of\n    three prospective African-American jurors were\n    stricken, and the record reflected different treatment\n    of comparably situated jurors.” Id., at 641.\nThat decision is as inexplicable as it is unexplained. It is\nreversed.\n   The Batson issue before us turns largely on an “evalua\ntion of credibility.” 476 U.S., at 98, n. 21. The trial\ncourt’s determination is entitled to “great deference,” ibid.,\nand “must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous,”\nSnyder v. Louisiana, 552 U.S. 472, 477 (2008).\n   That is the standard on direct review. On federal ha\nbeas review, AEDPA “imposes a highly deferential stan\ndard for evaluating state-court rulings” and “demands\nthat state-court decisions be given the benefit of the\ndoubt.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,\nat 5) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here the trial\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

LOUISIANA\n               ON PETITION FOR REHEARING\n\n                       [October 1, 2008]\n\n  Statement of JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE joins, respecting the denial of rehearing.\n   Respondent has moved for rehearing of this case be-\ncause there has come to light a federal statute enacted in\n2006 permitting the death sentence under the Uniform\nCode of Military Justice for rape of a minor. See Pub L.\n109–163, §552(b)(1), 119 Stat. 3263. This provision was\nnot cited by either party, nor by any of the numerous\namici in the case; it was first brought to the Court’s atten-\ntion after the opinion had issued, in a letter signed by 85\nMembers of Congress. Respondent asserts that rehearing\nis justified because this statute calls into question the\nmajority opinion’s conclusion that there is a national\nconsensus against capital punishment for rape of a child.\n   I am voting against the petition for rehearing because\nthe views of the American people on the death penalty for\nchild rape were, to tell the truth, irrelevant to the major-\nity’s decision in this case. The majority opinion, after an\nunpersuasive attempt to show that a consensus against\nthe penalty existed, in the end came down to this: “[T]he\nConstitution contemplates that in the end our own judg-\nment will be brought to bear on the question of the accept-\nability of the death penalty under the Eighth Amend-\nment.” Ante, at ___ (slip op., at 24). Of course the\nConstitution contemplates no such thing; the proposed\n2                 KENNEDY v. LOUISIANA\n\n                    Statement of SCALIA, J.\n\nEighth Amendment would have been laughed to scorn if it\nhad read “no criminal penalty shall be imposed which the\nSupreme Court deems unacceptable.” But that is what\nthe majority opinion said, and there is no reason to believe\nthat absence of a national consensus would provoke second\nthoughts.\n   While the new evidence of American opinion is ulti-\nmately irrelevant to the majority’s decision, let there be no\ndoubt that it utterly destroys the majority’s claim to be\ndiscerning a national consensus and not just giving effect\nto the majority’s own preference. As noted in the letter\nfrom Members of Congress, the bill providing the death\npenalty for child rape passed the Senate 95–0; it passed\nthe House 374–41, with the votes of a majority of each\nState’s delegation; and was signed by the President.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY’s statement posits two reasons why this\nact by Congress proves nothing about the national consen-\nsus regarding permissible penalties for child rape. First,\nit claims the statute merely “reclassif[ied]” the offense of\nchild rape. Ante, at 2. But the law did more than that; it\nspecifically established (as it would have to do) the penalty\nfor the new offense of child rape—and that penalty was\ndeath: “For an offense under subsection (a) (rape) or sub-\nsection (b) (rape of a child), death or such other punish-\nment as a court-martial may direct.” §552(b)(1), 119 Stat.\n3263 (emphasis added). By separate executive order, the\nPresident later expressly reauthorized the death penalty\nas a punishment for child rape. Exec. Order No. 13447, 72\nFed. Reg. 56214 (2007). Based on these acts, there is\ninfinitely more reason to think that Congress and the\nPresident made a judgment regarding the appropriateness\nof the death penalty for child rape than there is to think\nthat the many non-enacting state legislatures upon which\nthe majority relies did so—especially since it was widely\nbelieved that Coker took the capital-punishment option off\nthe table. See Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584 (1977).\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                    Statement of SCALIA, J.\n\n\n  Second, JUSTICE KENNEDY speculates that the Eighth\nAmendment may permit subjecting a member of the mili-\ntary to a means of punishment that would be cruel and\nunusual if inflicted upon a civilian for the same crime.\nThat is perhaps so where the fact of the malefactor’s\nmembership in the Armed Forces makes the offense more\ngrievous. One can imagine, for example, a social judgment\nthat treason by a military officer who has sworn to defend\nhis country deserves the death penalty even though trea-\nson by a civilian does not. (That is not the social judgment\nour society has made, see 18 U.S. C. §2381, but one can\nimagine it.) It is difficult to imagine, however, how rape of\na child could sometimes be deserving of death for a soldier\nbut never for a civilian.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

He had received no law library access while in jail before trial—despite his repeated requests and court orders to the contrary—and only about four hours of access during trial, just before closing arguments. (Of course, he had declined, as was his right, to be represented by a lawyer with unlimited access to legal materials.) The California courts rejected his argument that his restricted library access violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Once his sentence became final, he petitioned in Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. §2254. The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that \"the lack of any pretrial access to lawbooks violated Espitia's constitutional right to represent himself as established by the Supreme Court in Faretta [v. California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975)].\" Garcia Espitia v. Ortiz, 113 Fed. Appx. 802, 804 (2004). The warden's petition for certiorari and respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment below reversed, and the case remanded.\n\n\n2\nA necessary condition for federal habeas relief here is that the state court's decision be \"contrary to, or involv[e] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Neither the opinion below, nor any of the appellate cases it relies on, identifies a source in our case law for the law library access right other than Faretta. See 113 Fed. Appx., at 804 (relying on Bribiesca v. Galaza, 215 F. 3d 1015, 1020 (CA9 2000) (quoting Milton v. Morris, 767 F. 2d 1443, 1446 (CA9 1985)); ibid. (\"Faretta controls this case\").\n\n\n3\nThe federal appellate courts have split on whether Faretta, which establishes a Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, implies a right of the pro se defendant to have access to a law library. Compare Milton, supra, with United States v. Smith, 907 F. 2d 42, 45 (CA6 1990) (\"[B]y knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to counsel, the appellant also relinquished his access to a law library\"); United States ex rel. George v. Lane, 718 F. 2d 226, 231 (CA7 1983) (similar). That question cannot be resolved here, however, as it is clear that Faretta does not, as §2254(d)(1) requires, \"clearly establis[h]\" the law library access right. In fact, Faretta says nothing about any specific legal aid that the State owes a pro se criminal defendant. The Bribiesca court and the court below therefore erred in holding, based on Faretta, that a violation of a law library access right is a basis for federal habeas relief.\n\n\n4\nThe judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

ANDREW CARMAN, ET UX.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 14–212.   Decided November 10, 2014\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   On July 3, 2009, the Pennsylvania State Police Depart-\nment received a report that a man named Michael Zita\nhad stolen a car and two loaded handguns. The report\nalso said that Zita might have fled to the home of Andrew\nand Karen Carman. The department sent Officers Jeremy\nCarroll and Brian Roberts to the Carmans’ home to inves-\ntigate. Neither officer had been to the home before. 749\nF.3d 192, 195 (CA3 2014).\n   The officers arrived in separate patrol cars around 2:30\np.m. The Carmans’ house sat on a corner lot—the front of\nthe house faced a main street while the left (as viewed\nfrom the front) faced a side street. The officers initially\ndrove to the front of the house, but after discovering that\nparking was not available there, turned right onto the side\nstreet. As they did so, they saw several cars parked side-\nby-side in a gravel parking area on the left side of the\nCarmans’ property. The officers parked in the “first avail-\nable spot,” at “the far rear of the property.” Ibid. (quoting\nTr. 70 (Apr. 8, 2013)).\n   The officers exited their patrol cars. As they looked\ntoward the house, the officers saw a small structure (ei-\nther a carport or a shed) with its door open and a light on.\nId., at 71. Thinking someone might be inside, Officer\nCarroll walked over, “poked [his] head” in, and said\n“Pennsylvania State Police.” 749 F.3d, at 195 (quoting Tr.\n71 (Apr. 8, 2013); alteration in original). No one was\nthere, however, so the officers continued walking toward\nthe house. As they approached, they saw a sliding glass\n2                   CARROLL v. CARMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndoor that opened onto a ground-level deck. Carroll\nthought the sliding glass door “looked like a customary\nentryway,” so he and Officer Roberts decided to knock on\nit. 749 F.3d, at 195 (quoting Tr. 83 (Apr. 8, 2013)).\n   As the officers stepped onto the deck, a man came out\nof the house and “belligerent[ly] and aggressively ap-\nproached” them. 749 F.3d, at 195. The officers identified\nthemselves, explained they were looking for Michael Zita,\nand asked the man for his name. The man refused to\nanswer. Instead, he turned away from the officers and\nappeared to reach for his waist. Id., at 195–196. Carroll\ngrabbed the man’s right arm to make sure he was not\nreaching for a weapon. The man twisted away from Car-\nroll, lost his balance, and fell into the yard. Id., at 196.\n   At that point, a woman came out of the house and asked\nwhat was happening. The officers again explained that\nthey were looking for Zita. The woman then identified\nherself as Karen Carman, identified the man as her hus-\nband, Andrew Carman, and told the officers that Zita was\nnot there. In response, the officers asked for permission to\nsearch the house for Zita. Karen Carman consented, and\neveryone went inside. Ibid.\n   The officers searched the house, but did not find Zita.\nThey then left. The Carmans were not charged with any\ncrimes. Ibid.\n   The Carmans later sued Officer Carroll in Federal\nDistrict Court under 42 U.S. C. §1983. Among other\nthings, they alleged that Carroll unlawfully entered their\nproperty in violation of the Fourth Amendment when he\nwent into their backyard and onto their deck without a\nwarrant. 749 F.3d, at 196.\n   At trial, Carroll argued that his entry was lawful under\nthe “knock and talk” exception to the warrant require-\nment. That exception, he contended, allows officers to\nknock on someone’s door, so long as they stay “on those\nportions of [the] property that the general public is al-\n                  Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nlowed to go on.” Tr. 7 (Apr. 8, 2013). The Carmans re-\nsponded that a normal visitor would have gone to their\nfront door, rather than into their backyard or onto their\ndeck. Thus, they argued, the “knock and talk” exception\ndid not apply.\n  At the close of Carroll’s case in chief, the parties each\nmoved for judgment as a matter of law. The District Court\ndenied both motions, and sent the case to a jury. As rele-\nvant here, the District Court instructed the jury that the\n“knock and talk” exception “allows officers without a\nwarrant to knock on a resident’s door or otherwise ap-\nproach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants,\njust as any private citizen might.” Id., at 24 (Apr. 10,\n2013). The District Court further explained that “officers\nshould restrict their movements to walkways, driveways,\nporches and places where visitors could be expected to go.”\nIbid. The jury then returned a verdict for Carroll.\n  The Carmans appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit reversed in relevant part. The court held\nthat Officer Carroll violated the Fourth Amendment as a\nmatter of law because the “knock and talk” exception\n“requires that police officers begin their encounter at the\nfront door, where they have an implied invitation to go.”\n749 F.3d, at 199. The court also held that Carroll was not\nentitled to qualified immunity because his actions violated\nclearly established law. Ibid. The court therefore re-\nversed the District Court and held that the Carmans were\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  Carroll petitioned for certiorari. We grant the petition\nand reverse the Third Circuit’s determination that Carroll\nwas not entitled to qualified immunity.\n  A government official sued under §1983 is entitled to\nqualified immunity unless the official violated a statutory\nor constitutional right that was clearly established at the\ntime of the challenged conduct. See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 3). A right is clearly\n4                    CARROLL v. CARMAN\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nestablished only if its contours are sufficiently clear that\n“a reasonable official would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483\nU.S. 635, 640 (1987). In other words, “existing precedent\nmust have placed the statutory or constitutional question\nbeyond debate.” al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\nThis doctrine “gives government officials breathing room\nto make reasonable but mistaken judgments,” and “pro-\ntects ‘all but the plainly incompetent or those who know-\ningly violate the law.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986)).\n   Here the Third Circuit cited only a single case to sup-\nport its decision that Carroll was not entitled to qualified\nimmunity—Estate of Smith v. Marasco, 318 F.3d 497\n(CA3 2003). Assuming for the sake of argument that a\ncontrolling circuit precedent could constitute clearly estab-\nlished federal law in these circumstances, see Reichle v.\nHowards, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7), Marasco\ndoes not clearly establish that Carroll violated the Car-\nmans’ Fourth Amendment rights.\n   In Marasco, two police officers went to Robert Smith’s\nhouse and knocked on the front door. When Smith did not\nrespond, the officers went into the backyard, and at least\none entered the garage. 318 F.3d, at 519. The court\nacknowledged that the officers’ “entry into the curtilage\nafter not receiving an answer at the front door might be\nreasonable.” Id., at 520. It held, however, that the Dis-\ntrict Court had not made the factual findings needed to\ndecide that issue. Id., at 521. For example, the Third\nCircuit noted that the record “did not discuss the layout of\nthe property or the position of the officers on that prop-\nerty,” and that “there [was] no indication of whether the\nofficers followed a path or other apparently open route\nthat would be suggestive of reasonableness.” Ibid. The\ncourt therefore remanded the case for further proceedings.\n   In concluding that Officer Carroll violated clearly estab-\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlished law in this case, the Third Circuit relied exclusively\non Marasco’s statement that “entry into the curtilage after\nnot receiving an answer at the front door might be reason-\nable.” Id., at 520; see 749 F.3d, at 199 (quoting Marasco,\nsupra, at 520). In the court’s view, that statement clearly\nestablished that a “knock and talk” must begin at the\nfront door. But that conclusion does not follow. Marasco\nheld that an unsuccessful “knock and talk” at the front\ndoor does not automatically allow officers to go onto other\nparts of the property. It did not hold, however, that\nknocking on the front door is required before officers go\nonto other parts of the property that are open to visitors.\nThus, Marasco simply did not answer the question whether\na “knock and talk” must begin at the front door when\nvisitors may also go to the back door. Indeed, the house at\nissue seems not to have even had a back door, let alone\none that visitors could use. 318 F.3d, at 521.\n   Moreover, Marasco expressly stated that “there [was] no\nindication of whether the officers followed a path or other\napparently open route that would be suggestive of reason-\nableness.” Ibid. That makes Marasco wholly different\nfrom this case, where the jury necessarily decided that\nCarroll “restrict[ed] [his] movements to walkways, drive-\nways, porches and places where visitors could be expected\nto go.” Tr. 24 (Apr. 10, 2013).\n   To the extent that Marasco says anything about this\ncase, it arguably supports Carroll’s view. In Marasco, the\nThird Circuit noted that “[o]fficers are allowed to knock on\na residence’s door or otherwise approach the residence\nseeking to speak to the inhabitants just as any private\ncitizen may.” 318 F.3d, at 519. The court also said that,\n“ ‘when the police come on to private property . . . and\nrestrict their movements to places visitors could be ex-\npected to go (e.g., walkways, driveways, porches), observa-\ntions made from such vantage points are not covered by\nthe Fourth Amendment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 1 W. LaFave,\n6                       CARROLL v. CARMAN\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nSearch and Seizure §2.3(f ) (3d ed. 1996 and Supp. 2003)\n(footnotes omitted)). Had Carroll read those statements\nbefore going to the Carmans’ house, he may have concluded—\nquite reasonably—that he was allowed to knock on any\ndoor that was open to visitors.*\n   The Third Circuit’s decision is even more perplexing in\ncomparison to the decisions of other federal and state\ncourts, which have rejected the rule the Third Circuit\nadopted here. For example, in United States v. Titemore,\n437 F.3d 251 (CA2 2006), a police officer approached a\nhouse that had two doors. The first was a traditional door\nthat opened onto a driveway; the second was a sliding\nglass door that opened onto a small porch. The officer\nchose to knock on the latter. Id., at 253–254. On appeal,\nthe defendant argued that the officer had unlawfully\nentered his property without a warrant in violation of the\nFourth Amendment. Id., at 255–256. But the Second\nCircuit rejected that argument. As the court explained,\nthe sliding glass door was “a primary entrance visible to\nand used by the public.” Id., at 259. Thus, “[b]ecause [the\nofficer] approached a principal entrance to the home using\na route that other visitors could be expected to take,” the\ncourt held that he did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nId., at 252.\n   The Seventh Circuit’s decision in United States v.\nJames, 40 F.3d 850 (1994), vacated on other grounds, 516\nU.S. 1022 (1995), provides another example. There, police\n——————\n  * In a footnote, the Court of Appeals “recognize[d] that there may be\nsome instances in which the front door is not the entrance used by\nvisitors,” but noted that “this is not one such instance.” 749 F.3d 192,\n198, n. 6 (2014) (emphasis added). This footnote still reflects the Third\nCircuit’s view that the “knock and talk” exception is available for only\none entrance to a dwelling, “which in most circumstances is the front\ndoor.” Id., at 198. Cf. United States v. Perea-Rey, 680 F.3d 1179, 1188\n(CA9 2012) (“Officers conducting a knock and talk . . . need not ap-\nproach only a specific door if there are multiple doors accessible to the\npublic.”).\n                 Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nofficers approached a duplex with multiple entrances.\nBypassing the front door, the officers “used a paved walk-\nway along the side of the duplex leading to the rear side\ndoor.” 40 F.3d, at 862. On appeal, the defendant argued\nthat the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights\nwhen they went to the rear side door. The Seventh Circuit\nrejected that argument, explaining that the rear side door\nwas “accessible to the general public” and “was commonly\nused for entering the duplex from the nearby alley.” Ibid.\nIn situations “where the back door of a residence is readily\naccessible to the general public,” the court held, “the\nFourth Amendment is not implicated when police officers\napproach that door in the reasonable belief that it is a\nprincipal means of access to the dwelling.” Ibid. See also,\ne.g., United States v. Garcia, 997 F.2d 1273, 1279–1280\n(CA9 1993) (“If the front and back of a residence are read-\nily accessible from a public place, like the driveway and\nparking area here, the Fourth Amendment is not implicated\nwhen officers go to the back door reasonably believing it\nis used as a principal entrance to the dwelling”); State v.\nDomicz, 188 N. J. 285, 302, 907 A.2d 395, 405 (2006)\n(“when a law enforcement officer walks to a front or back\ndoor for the purpose of making contact with a resident and\nreasonably believes that the door is used by visitors, he is\nnot unconstitutionally trespassing on to the property”).\n   We do not decide today whether those cases were cor-\nrectly decided or whether a police officer may conduct a\n“knock and talk” at any entrance that is open to visitors\nrather than only the front door. “But whether or not the\nconstitutional rule applied by the court below was correct,\nit was not ‘beyond debate.’ ” Stanton v.

The District Court granted his discovery motion and dismissed the notice after the Government said that it would not comply with the discovery order. The Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit's decision is contrary to United States v. Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 465, in which this Court held that a defendant seeking discovery on a selective prosecution claim must show some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent. As to evidence of discriminatory effect, a defendant must make a credible showing that similarly situated individuals of a different race were not prosecuted. Id., at 465, 470. The Sixth Circuit concluded that respondent had made such a showing based on nationwide statistics demonstrating that the Government charges blacks with a death-eligible offense more than twice as often as it charges whites and that it enters into plea bargains more frequently with whites than with blacks. Even assuming that a nationwide showing can satisfy the Armstrong requirement, raw statistics regarding overall charges say nothing about charges brought against similarly situated defendants. And the plea bargain statistics are even less relevant, since respondent declined the plea bargain offered him.\nCertiorari granted; 266 F. 3d 532, reversed.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nA federal grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Michigan returned a second superseding indictment charging respondent with, inter alia, the intentional firearm killings of two individuals. The United States filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Respondent, who is black, alleged that the Government had determined to seek the death penalty against him because of his race. He moved to dismiss the death penalty notice and, in the alternative, for discovery of information relating to the Government's capital charging practices. The District Court granted the motion for discovery, and after the Government informed the court that it would not comply with the discovery order, the court dismissed the death penalty notice. A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's discovery order. 266 F. 3d 532 (2001). We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and now summarily reverse.\n\n\n2\nIn United States v. Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 465 (1996), we held that a defendant who seeks discovery on a claim of selective prosecution must show some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent. We need go no further in the present case than consideration of the evidence supporting discriminatory effect. As to that, Armstrong says that the defendant must make a \"credible showing\" that \"similarly situated individuals of a different race were not prosecuted.\" Id., at 465, 470. The Sixth Circuit concluded that respondent had made such a showing based on nationwide statistics demonstrating that \"[t]he United States charges blacks with a death-eligible offense more than twice as often as it charges whites\" and that the United States enters into plea bargains more frequently with whites than it does with blacks. 266 F. 3d, at 538-539 (citing U. S. Dept. of Justice, The Federal Death Penalty System: A Statistical Survey (1988-2000), p. 2 (Sept. 12, 2000)).* Even assuming that the Armstrong requirement can be satisfied by a nationwide showing (as opposed to a showing regarding the record of the decisionmakers in respondent's case), raw statistics regarding overall charges say nothing about charges brought against similarly situated defendants. And the statistics regarding plea bargains are even less relevant, since respondent was offered a plea bargain but declined it. See Pet. for Cert. 16. Under Armstrong, therefore, because respondent failed to submit relevant evidence that similarly situated persons were treated differently, he was not entitled to discovery.\n\n\n3\nThe Sixth Circuit's decision is contrary to Armstrong and threatens the \"performance of a core executive constitutional function.\" Armstrong, supra, at 465. For that reason, we reverse.\n\n\n4\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n In January 1995, the Department of Justice (DOJ) instituted a policy, known as the death penalty protocol, that required the Attorney General to make the decision whether to seek the death penalty once a defendant had been charged with a capital-eligible offense. See Pet. for Cert. 3 (citing DOJ, United States Attorneys' Manual § 9-10.010et seq. (Sept. 1997)). The charging decision continued to be made by one of the 93 United States Attorneys throughout the country, but the protocol required that the United States Attorneys submit for review all cases in which they had charged a defendant with a capital-eligible offense.

CITY OF BOISE, IDAHO, ET AL.\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                   COURT OF IDAHO\n\n             No. 15–493.   Decided January 25, 2016\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Under federal law, a court has discretion to “allow the\nprevailing party, other than the United States, a reason-\nable attorney’s fee” in a civil rights lawsuit filed under 42\nU.S. C. §1983. 42 U.S. C. §1988. In Hughes v. Rowe, 449\nU.S. 5 (1980) (per curiam), this Court interpreted §1988 to\npermit a prevailing defendant in such a suit to recover\nfees only if “the plaintiff ’s action was frivolous, unreason-\nable, or without foundation.” Id., at 14 (quoting Chris-\ntiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421 (1978)\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   In the decision below, the Idaho Supreme Court con-\ncluded that it was not bound by this Court’s interpretation\nof §1988 in Hughes. According to that court, “[a]lthough\nthe Supreme Court may have the authority to limit the\ndiscretion of lower federal courts, it does not have the\nauthority to limit the discretion of state courts where such\nlimitation is not contained in the statute.” 158 Idaho\n713, 734, 351 P.3d 1171, 1192 (2015). The court then pro-\nceeded to award attorney’s fees under §1988 to a prevailing\ndefendant without first determining that “the plaintiff ’s\naction was frivolous, unreasonable, or without founda-\ntion.” The court’s fee award rested solely on its interpreta-\ntion of federal law; the court explicitly refused to award\nfees under state law. Id., at 734–735, 351 P. 3d, at 1192–\n1193. We grant certiorari, and now reverse.\n   Section 1988 is a federal statute. “It is this Court’s\nresponsibility to say what a [federal] statute means, and\nonce the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other courts to\n2                      JAMES v.

As Jus-\ntice Story explained 200 years ago, if state courts were\npermitted to disregard this Court’s rulings on federal law,\n“the laws, the treaties, and the constitution of the United\nStates would be different in different states, and might,\nperhaps, never have precisely the same construction,\nobligation, or efficacy, in any two states. The public mis-\nchiefs that would attend such a state of things would be\ntruly deplorable.” Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 1 Wheat.\n304, 348 (1816).\n   The Idaho Supreme Court, like any other state or fed-\neral court, is bound by this Court’s interpretation of federal\nlaw. The state court erred in concluding otherwise. The\njudgment of the Idaho Supreme Court is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748, and Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, but did not determine whether his separate evidentiary and prosecutorial misconduct claims would independently support the conviction's reversal. The State Supreme Court addressed only the Wheeler/Batson claim in reversing and remanding the case for further proceedings.\nHeld: The case is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. This Court's jurisdiction is limited to review of \"[f]inal judgments . . . rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had.\" 28 U. S. C. § 1257. The instant case falls outside of the exceptional categories of cases that can be regarded as \"final\" under § 1257 despite the ordering of further proceedings. Because compliance with § 1257 is an essential prerequisite to this Court's deciding a case's merits, the Court has an obligation to raise any such compliance question on its own. However, the Court is not always successful in policing this gatekeeping function without counsel's aid. Part of the problem here was that the portion of the State Court of Appeal's decision certified for publication addressed the Wheeler/Batson claim, but the unpublished portion addressed petitioner's evidentiary claims to provide guidance for the trial court on retrial. Petitioner appended only the opinion's published portion to his certiorari petition. Had the full opinion been brought to this Court's attention, it might have been more evident that the State Supreme Court's decision was not final under § 1257. Attention to whether a decision is indeed a \"[f]inal judgmen[t]\" is mandated by this Court's Rules and will avoid expenditure of resources of both counsel and the Court on an abortive proceeding such as this.\nCertiorari dismissed. Reported below: 30 Cal. 4th 1302, 71 P. 3d 270.\nCERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.\nStephen B. Bedrick, by appointment of the Court, 540 U. S. 1102, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was Eric Schnapper.\nSeth K. Schalit, Supervising Deputy Attorney General of California, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Bill Lockyer, Attorney General, Manuel Medeiros, State Solicitor General, Robert R. Anderson, Chief Assistant Attorney General, Gerald A. Engler, Senior Assistant Attorney General, and Laurence K. Sullivan, Supervising Deputy Attorney General.*\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari in this case to review a decision of the Supreme Court of California interpreting Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986). 540 U. S. 1045 (2003). The case was briefed and argued, but we now conclude that we are without jurisdiction in the matter.\n\n\n2\nThe California Supreme Court reversed the California Court of Appeal's decision reversing petitioner's conviction. 30 Cal. 4th 1302, 71 P. 3d 270 (2003). The Court of Appeal held that petitioner was entitled to relief under People v. Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978), and Batson v. Kentucky, supra. 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001). It also noted petitioner's separate evidentiary and prosecutorial misconduct claims, App. 87, but did not determine whether those claims would independently support reversal of petitioner's conviction. The California Supreme Court addressed only the Wheeler/Batson claim, and, after reversing on that ground, remanded \"for further proceedings consistent with [its] opinion.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1328, 71 P. 3d, at 287.\n\n\n3\nUnder 28 U. S. C. § 1257, our jurisdiction is limited to review of \"[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had.\" In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469 (1975), we described four exceptional categories of cases to be regarded as \"final\" on the federal issue despite the ordering of further proceedings in the lower state courts. In a post-oral-argument supplemental brief, petitioner argues that the fourth of these categories fits this case. That category involves situations\n\n\n4\n\"where the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come. In these circumstances, if a refusal immediately to review the state-court decision might seriously erode federal policy, the Court has entertained and decided the federal issue, which itself has been finally determined by the state courts for purposes of the state litigation.\" Id., at 482-483.\n\n\n5\nHere, petitioner can make no convincing claim of erosion of federal policy that is not common to all decisions rejecting a defendant's Batson claim. The fourth category therefore does not apply. See Florida v. Thomas, 532 U. S. 774, 780 (2001). \"A contrary conclusion would permit the fourth exception to swallow the rule.\" Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U. S. 619, 622 (1981) (per curiam).\n\n\n6\nThe present case comes closest to fitting in the third Cox category, but ultimately falls outside of it. That category involves \"those situations where the federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case.\" Cox, supra, at 481. In the event that the California Court of Appeal on remand affirms the judgment of conviction, petitioner could once more seek review of his Batson claim in the Supreme Court of California—albeit unsuccessfully—and then seek certiorari on that claim from this Court.\n\n\n7\nCompliance with the provisions of § 1257 is an essential prerequisite to our deciding the merits of a case brought here under that section. It is our obligation to raise any question of such compliance on our own motion, even though counsel has not called our attention to it. See, e. g., Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 384 (1884). But as the present case illustrates, we are not always successful in policing this gatekeeping function without the aid of counsel.\n\n\n8\nPart of the problem was that the California Court of Appeal's decision was certified by that court for partial publication. It addressed the Wheeler/Batson claim in the published portion. 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001). In the unpublished portion, the court briefly addressed petitioner's evidentiary claims to provide guidance for the trial court on retrial, and noted that it would not address whether petitioner's objections were properly preserved or consider petitioner's prosecutorial misconduct claim. App. 58. Petitioner appended only the published portion of the California Court of Appeal's decision to his petition for a writ of certiorari. This Court's Rule 14.1(i) instructs petitioners to include, inter alia, any \"relevant opinions . . . entered in the case\" in the appendix to the petition for certiorari. The full opinion of the California Court of Appeal was not filed in this Court until the joint appendix to the briefs on the merits was filed. App. 58-112. Had the full opinion been brought to this Court's attention, it might have been more evident to us that the Supreme Court of California's decision was not final for the purposes of § 1257.\n\n\n9\nA petition for certiorari must demonstrate to this Court that it has jurisdiction to review the judgment. This Court's Rule 14.1(g). And a respondent has a duty to \"address any perceived misstatement of fact or law in the petition that bears on what issues properly would be before the Court if certiorari were granted.\" Rule 15.2. Our Rules also require that each party provide a statement for the basis of our jurisdiction in its brief on the merits. Rule 24.1(e). At all stages in this case, both parties represented that our jurisdiction was proper pursuant to § 1257(a). Pet. for Cert. 1; Brief in Support 1; Brief for Petitioner 1; Brief for Respondent 1.\n\n\n10\nIt behooves counsel for both petitioner and respondent to assure themselves that the decision for which review is sought is indeed a \"[f]inal judgmen[t]\" under § 1257. Such attention is mandated by our Rules and will avoid the expenditure of resources of both counsel and of this Court on an abortive proceeding such as the present one.\n\n\n11\nWe dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n12\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n A brief ofamici curiae urging reversal was filed for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., et al. by Elaine R.

BLUE FOX, INC.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\nJanuary 20, 1999\nChief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAn insolvent prime contractor failed to pay a subcontractor for work the latter completed on a construction project for the Department of the Army. The Department of the Army having required no Miller Act bond from the prime contractor, the subcontractor sought to collect directly from the Army by asserting an equitable lien on certain funds held by the Army. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that §10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 702 waived the Government's immunity for the subcontractor's claim. We hold that §702 did not nullify the long settled rule that sovereign immunity bars creditors from enforcing liens on Government property.\n\n\n2\nParticipating in a business development program for socially and economically disadvantaged firms run by the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Department of the Army contracted with Verdan Technology, Inc., in September 1993, to install a telephone switching system at an Army depot in Umatilla, Oregon. Verdan, in turn, employed respondent Blue Fox, Inc., as a subcontractor on the project to construct a concrete block building to house the telephone system and to install certain safety and support systems.\n\n\n3\nUnder the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. § 270a 270d, a contractor that performs \"construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work of the United States\" generally must post two types of bonds. §270a(a). First, the contractor must post a \"performance bond   for the protection of the United States\" against defaults by the contractor. §270a(a)(1). Second, the contractor must post a \"payment bond   for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material.\" §270a(a)(2). The Miller Act gives the subcontractors and other suppliers \"the right to sue on such payment bond for the amount, or the balance thereof, unpaid at the time of institution of such suit and to prosecute said action to final execution and judgment for the sum or  sums justly due him.\" §270b. Although the Army's original solicitation in this case required the contractor to furnish payment and performance bonds if the contract price exceeded $25,000, the Army later amended the solicitation, treated the contract as a \"services contract,\" and deleted the bond requirements. Verdan therefore did not post any Miller Act bonds.\n\n\n4\nBlue Fox performed its obligations, but Verdan failed to pay it the $46,586.14 that remained due on the subcontract. After receiving notices from Blue Fox that it had not been fully paid, the Army nonetheless disbursed a total of $86,132.33 to Verdan as payment for all work that Verdan had completed. In January 1995, the Army terminated its contract with Verdan for various defaults and another contractor completed the Umatilla project. Blue Fox obtained a default judgment in tribal court against Verdan. Seeing that it could not collect from Verdan or its officers, it sued the Army for the balance due on its contract with Verdan in Federal District Court.1\n\n\n5\nPredicating jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the APA, Blue Fox sought an \"equitable lien\" on any funds from the Verdan contract not paid to Verdan, or any funds available or appropriated for completion of the Umatilla project, and an order directing payment of those funds to it. Blue Fox also sought an injunction preventing the Army from paying any more money on the Verdan contract or on the follow-on contract until Blue Fox was paid. By the time of the suit, however, the Army had paid all amounts due on the Verdan contract, Blue Fox failed to obtain any preliminary relief, and the Army subsequently paid the replacement contractor the funds remaining on the Verdan contract plus additional funds.2\n\n\n6\nOn cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that the waiver of sovereign immunity provided by the APA did not apply to respondent's claim against the Army. The District Court thus concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over respondent's claim and accordingly granted the Army's motion for summary judgment. In a split decision, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part. See Blue Fox Inc. v. Small Business Admin., 121 F.3d 1357 (1997). The majority held that under this Court's decision in Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988), the APA waives immunity for equitable actions. Based in part on its analysis of several of our cases examining a surety's right of subrogation, the majority held that the APA had waived the Army's immunity from Blue Fox's suit to recover the  amount withheld by the Army. The majority concluded that the lien attached to funds retained by the Army but owed to Verdan at the time the Army received Blue Fox's notice that Verdan had failed to pay. The majority stated that \"the Army cannot escape Blue Fox's equitable lien by wrongly paying out funds to the prime contractor when it had notice of Blue Fox's unpaid claims.\" 121 F.3d, at 1363.\n\n\n7\nThe dissenting judge stated that \"no matter how you slice Blue Fox's claim, it seeks funds from the treasury to compensate for the Army's failure to require Verdan to post a bond.\" Id., at 1364 (opinion of Rymer, J.). In her view, Congress chose to protect subcontractors like Blue Fox through the bond requirements of the Miller Act, not by waiving immunity in the APA to permit subcontractors to sue the United States directly for amounts owed to them by the prime contractor. Because this rule has been \"conventional wisdom for at least fifty years,\" she did not agree that Congress had waived the Army's sovereign immunity from Blue Fox's suit. Ibid. The Government petitioned for review, and we granted certiorari to decide whether the APA has waived the Government's immunity from suits to enforce an equitable lien. 523 U.S. __ (1998).\n\n\n8\n\"Absent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit.\" FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994). Congress, of course, has waived its immunity for a wide range of suits, including those that seek traditional money damages. Examples are the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2671 et seq., and the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491.3 They are not involved here. Respondent sued the Army under §702 of the APA, which provides in relevant part:\n\n\n9\n\"A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof. An action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party.\" 5 U.S.C. § 702 (emphasis added).\n\n\n10\nRespondent asks us to hold, as did the court below, that this provision, which waives the Government's immunity from actions seeking relief \"other than money damages,\" allows subcontractors to place liens on funds  held by the United States Government for work completed on a prime contract. We have frequently held, however, that a waiver of sovereign immunity is to be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign. See, e.g., Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996) (citing cases); Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310, 318 (1986). Such a waiver must also be \"unequivocally expressed\" in the statutory text. See Lane, supra, at 192. Respondent's claim must therefore meet this high standard.\n\n\n11\nRespondent argues, and the court below held, that our analysis of §702 in Bowen compels the allowance of respondent's lien. We disagree. In Bowen, we examined the text and legislative history of §702 to determine whether the Commonwealth of Massachusetts could sue the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act that required the payment of certain amounts to the State for Medicaid services. We held that the State's complaint in Bowen was not barred by the APA's prohibition on suits for money damages. The Court of Appeals below read our decision in Bowen as interpreting §702's reference to \"other than money damages\" as waiving immunity from all actions that are equitable in nature. See 121 F.3d, at 1361 (\"Since the APA waives immunity for equitable actions, the district court had jurisdiction under the APA\").\n\n\n12\nBowen's analysis of §702, however, did not turn on distinctions between \"equitable\" actions and other actions, nor could such a distinction have driven the Court's analysis in light of §702's language. As Bowen recognized, the crucial question under §702 is not whether a particular claim for relief is \"equitable\" (a term found nowhere in §702), but rather what Congress meant by \"other than money damages\" (the precise terms of §702). Bowen held that Congress employed this language to distinguish between specific relief and compensatory, or substitute, relief. The Court stated:\n\n\n13\n\" 'We begin with the ordinary meaning of the words Congress employed. The term \"money damages,\" 5 U.S.C. § 702 we think, normally refers to a sum of money used as compensatory relief. Damages are given to the plaintiff to substitute for a suffered loss, whereas specific remedies \"are not substitute remedies at all, but attempt to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled.'' ' '' 487 U.S., at 895 (quoting Maryland Dept. of Human Resources v. Department of Health and Human Services, 763 F.2d 1441, 1446 (CADC 1985) (citation omitted)).\n\n\n14\nBowen also concluded from its analysis of relevant legislative history that \"the drafters had in mind the time-honored distinction between damages and specific relief.\" 487 U.S., at 897. Bowen's interpretation of §702 thus hinged on the distinction between specific relief and substitute relief, not between equitable and nonequitable categories of remedies.\n\n\n15\nWe accordingly applied this interpretation of §702 to the State's suit to overturn a decision by the Secretary disallowing reimbursement under the Medicaid Act. We held that the State's suit was not one \"seeking money in compensation for the damage sustained by the failure of the Federal Government to pay as mandated; rather, it [was] a suit seeking to enforce the statutory mandate itself, which happens to be one for the payment of money.\" Id., at 900. The Court therefore concluded that the substance of the State's suit was one for specific relief, not money damages, and hence the suit fell within §702's waiver of immunity.\n\n\n16\nIt is clear from Bowen that the equitable nature of the lien sought by respondent here does not mean that its ultimate claim was not one for \"money damages\" within the meaning of §702. Liens, whether equitable or legal, are merely a means to the end of satisfying a claim for the recovery of money. Indeed, equitable liens by their nature constitute substitute or compensatory relief rather than specific relief. An equitable lien does not \"give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled,\" id., at 895 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); instead, it merely grants a plaintiff \"a security interest in the property, which [the plaintiff] can then use to satisfy a money claim,\" usually a claim for unjust enrichment. 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies §4.3(3), p. 601 (2d ed. 1993); see also Laycock, The Scope and Significance of Restitution, 67 Texas L. Rev. 1277, 1290 (1989) (\"The equitable lien is a hybrid, granting a money judgment and securing its collection with a lien on the specific thing\"). Commentators have warned not to view equitable liens as anything more than substitute relief:\n\n\n17\n\"[T]he form of the remedy requires that [a] lien or charge should be established, and then enforced, and the amount due obtained by a sale total or partial of the fund, or by a sequestration of its rents, profits, and proceeds. These preliminary steps may, on a casual view, be misleading as to the nature of the remedy, and may cause it to appear to be something more than compensatory; but a closer view shows that all these steps are merely auxiliary, and that  the real remedy, the final object of the proceeding, is the pecuniary recovery.\" 1 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence §112, p. 148 (5th ed. 1941).\n\n\n18\nSee also Dobbs, supra, at 601 (equitable lien foreclosure \"results in only a monetary payment to the plaintiff and obviously does not carry with it the advantages of recovering specific property\").\n\n\n19\nWe accordingly hold that the sort of equitable lien sought by respondent here constitutes a claim for \"money damages\"; its goal is to seize or attach money in the hands of the Government as compensation for the loss resulting from the default of the prime contractor. As a form of substitute and not specific relief, respondent's action to enforce an equitable lien falls outside of §702's waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\n\n20\nOur holding today is in accord with our precedent establishing that sovereign immunity bars creditors from attaching or garnishing funds in the Treasury, see Buchanan v. Alexander, 4 How. 20 (1845), or enforcing liens against property owned by the United States, see United States v. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co., 218 U.S. 452, 471 (1910); United States ex rel. Hill v. American Surety Co. of N. Y., 200 U.S. 197, 203 (1906) (\"As against the United States, no lien can be provided upon its public buildings or grounds\"). Respondent points to nothing in the text or history of §702 that suggests that Congress intended to overrule this precedent, let alone anything that \" 'unequivocally express[es]' \" such an intent. Lane, 518 U.S., at 192.\n\n\n21\nInstead, recognizing that sovereign immunity left subcontractors and suppliers without a remedy against the Government when the general contractor became insolvent, Congress enacted the Miller Act (and its predecessor the Heard Act) to protect these workers. See United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 241 (1947); Ansonia Brass & Copper Co., supra, at 471. But the Miller Act by its terms only gives subcontractors the right to sue on the surety bond posted by the prime contractor, not the right to recover their losses directly from the Government.\n\n\n22\nRespondent contends that in several cases examining a surety's right of equitable subrogation, this Court suggested that subcontractors and suppliers can seek compensation directly against the Government. See, e.g., Prairie State Bank v. United States, 164 U.S. 227 (1896); Henningsen v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. of Baltimore, 208 U.S. 404, 410 (1908); Pearlman v. Reliance Ins. Co., 371 U.S. 132, 141 (1962) (stating that \"the  laborers and materialmen had a right to be paid out of the fund [retained by the Government]\" and hence a surety was subrogated to this right); but see Munsey Trust Co., supra, at 241 (\"[N]othing is more clear than that laborers and materialmen do not have enforceable rights against the United States for their compensation\"). None of the cases relied upon by respondent involved a question of sovereign immunity, and, in fact, none involved a subcontractor directly asserting a claim against the Government. Instead, these cases dealt with disputes between private parties over priority to funds which had been transferred out of the Treasury and as to which the Government had disclaimed any ownership. They do not in any way disturb the established rule that, unless waived by Congress, sovereign immunity bars subcontractors and other creditors from enforcing liens on Government property or funds to recoup their losses.\n\n\n23\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n24\nIt is so ordered.\n\nNotes\n\n25\n1.  Although Blue Fox also named the SBA as a defendant, the District Court granted summary judgment in the SBA's favor, the Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, and Blue Fox has not challenged that ruling.\n\n\n26\n2.  The Army paid the replacement contractor, in part, with the funds from the undisbursed balance on the Verdan contract (approximately $85,000) which had been designated for certain work that Verdan failed to complete. No funds due to Verdan for work actually performed had been held back or retained by the Army. The Army paid the replacement contractor in July 1995, two months after Blue Fox filed its action against the Army in the District Court.\n\n\n27\n3.  The Federal Tort Claims Act provides that, subject to certain exceptions, \"[t]he United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2674. The Tucker Act grants the Court of Claims jurisdiction \"to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). The Tucker Act also gives federal district courts concurrent jurisdiction over  claims founded upon the same substantive grounds for relief but not exceeding $10,000 in damages.

Petitioners, who are African-American, sought promotions to fill two open shift manager positions, but two white males were selected instead. Alleging that Tyson had discriminated on account of race, petitioners sued under Rev. Stat. §1977, 42 U.S. C. §1981, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S. C. §2000e et seq.\nA trial proceeded in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. At the close of the plaintiffs' evidence, Tyson moved for judgment as a matter of law, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a). The District Court denied the motion, and the jury found for petitioners, awarding compensatory and punitive damages. The employer renewed its motion for judgment under Rule 50(b). The District Court granted the motion and, in the alternative, ordered a new trial as to both plaintiffs under Rule 50(c). App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a; see generally Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 4-11) (discussing Rule 50).\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 129 Fed. Appx. 529, 536 (2005) (per curiam). As to Ash, the court affirmed the grant of the Rule 50(b) motion, deeming the trial evidence insufficient to show pretext (and thus insufficient to show unlawful discrimination) under the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). 129 Fed. Appx., at 533-534. As to Hithon, the court reversed the Rule 50(b) ruling, finding there was enough evidence to go to the jury. The court, however, affirmed the District Court's alternative remedy of a new trial under Rule 50(c), holding that the evidence supported neither the decision to grant punitive damages nor the amount of the compensatory award, and thus that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a new trial. Id., at 536.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals, and the trial court rulings it affirmed, may be correct in the final analysis. In the course of its opinion, however, the Court of Appeals erred in two respects, requiring that its judgment now be vacated and the case remanded for further consideration.\nFirst, there was evidence that Tyson's plant manager, who made the disputed hiring decisions, had referred on some occasions to each of the petitioners as \"boy.\" Petitioners argued this was evidence of discriminatory animus. The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that \"[w]hile the use of `boy' when modified by a racial classification like `black' or `white' is evidence of discriminatory intent, the use of `boy' alone is not evidence of discrimination.\" Id., at 533 (citation omitted). Although it is true the disputed word will not always be evidence of racial animus, it does not follow that the term, standing alone, is always benign. The speaker's meaning may depend on various factors including context, inflection, tone of voice, local custom, and historical usage. Insofar as the Court of Appeals held that modifiers or qualifications are necessary in all instances to render the disputed term probative of bias, the court's decision is erroneous.\nSecond, the Court of Appeals erred in articulating the standard for determining whether the asserted non-discriminatory reasons for Tyson's hiring decisions were pretextual. Petitioners had introduced evidence that their qualifications were superior to those of the two successful applicants. (Part of the employer's defense was that the plant with the openings had performance problems and petitioners already worked there in a supervisory capacity.) The Court of Appeals, in finding petitioners' evidence insufficient, cited one of its earlier precedents and stated: \"Pretext can be established through comparing qualifications only when `the disparity in qualifications is so apparent as virtually to jump off the page and slap you in the face.'\" Ibid. (quoting Cooper v. Southern Co., 390 F.3d 695, 732 (CA11 2004)).\nUnder this Court's decisions, qualifications evidence may suffice, at least in some circumstances, to show pretext. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 187-188 (1989) (indicating a plaintiff \"might seek to demonstrate that respondent's claim to have promoted a better qualified applicant was pretextual by showing that she was in fact better qualified than the person chosen for the position\"), superseded on other grounds by 42 U.S. C. §1981(b); Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 259 (1981) (\"The fact that a court may think that the employer misjudged the qualifications of the applicants does not in itself expose him to Title VII liability, although this may be probative of whether the employer's reasons are pretexts for discrimination\"); cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148 (2000) (\"[A] plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated\").\nThe visual image of words jumping off the page to slap you (presumably a court) in the face is unhelpful and imprecise as an elaboration of the standard for inferring pretext from superior qualifications. Federal courts, including the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in a decision it cited here, have articulated various other standards, see, e.g., Cooper, supra, at 732 (noting that \"disparities in qualifications must be of such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Raad v. Fairbanks North Star Borough School Dist., 323 F.3d 1185, 1194 (CA9 2003) (holding that qualifications evidence standing alone may establish pretext where the plaintiff's qualifications are \"`clearly superior'\" to those of the selected job applicant); Aka v. Washington Hospital Center, 156 F.3d 1284, 1294 (CADC 1998) (en banc) (concluding the factfinder may infer pretext if \"a reasonable employer would have found the plaintiff to be significantly better qualified for the job\"), and in this case the Court of Appeals qualified its statement by suggesting that superior qualifications may be probative of pretext when combined with other evidence, see 129 Fed. Appx., at 533. This is not the occasion to define more precisely what standard should govern pretext claims based on superior qualifications. Today's decision, furthermore, should not be read to hold that petitioners' evidence necessarily showed pretext. The District Court concluded otherwise. It suffices to say here that some formulation other than the test the Court of Appeals articulated in this case would better ensure that trial courts reach consistent results.\nThe Court of Appeals should determine in the first instance whether the two aspects of its decision here determined to have been mistaken were essential to its holding. On these premises, certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Following this Court's denial of leave to Louisiana to file a bill of complaint against Mississippi in this Court, the District Court found the land in question to be part of Mississippi and quieted title in the plaintiffs.  The Court of Appeals reversed.\nHeld:  The uncompromising language of 28 U.S.C. § 1251(a), which gives to this Court \"original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States\" (emphasis added), deprived the District Court of jurisdiction over Louisiana's third-party complaint against Mississippi.  Though § 1251(a) is phrased in terms of a grant of jurisdiction to this Court, the plain meaning of \"exclusive\" necessarily denies jurisdiction of such cases to any other federal court.  See, e.g., California v. Arizona, 440 U.S. 59, 63, 99 S.Ct. 919, 922, 59 L.Ed.2d 144.  The District Court's adjudication of a private action involving the location of the boundary between two States does not violate § 1251(a), since that section speaks in terms of parties, not claims or issues.  But the adjudication of such an action would not be binding on the States in any way.  Because both of the Courts below intermixed the questions of title to real property and of the state boundary's location, it must be determined on remand whether on this record the claims of title may fairly be decided without additional proceedings in the District Court.  Pp. ____.\n937 F.2d 247, reversed and remanded.\nREHNQUIST, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nJames W. McCartney, Houston, Tex., argued for petitioners.\nGary L. Keyser, Baton Rouge, La., argued for respondents.\nChief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis action was originally commenced by private plaintiffs suing other private defendants in the District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi to quiet title to certain land riparian to the Mississippi River.  The State of Louisiana intervened in the action and filed a third-party complaint against the State of Mississippi seeking to determine the boundary between the two States in the vicinity of the disputed land.  We hold that 28 U.S.C. § 1251(a), granting to this Court original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two States, deprived the District Court of jurisdiction of Louisiana's third-party complaint against Mississippi.\n\n\n2\nThe land in question lies along the west bank of the Mississippi River near Lake Providence, Louisiana.  The private plaintiffs, known as the Houston Group, alleged that they own the land in fee simple as a result of a homestead patent issued by the United States in 1888 and a deed issued by Mississippi in 1933. Louisiana and the Lake Providence Port Commission intervened in the title dispute and filed a third-party complaint against Mississippi seeking a determination of the boundary between the States.  Louisiana then sought leave to file a bill of complaint against Mississippi in this Court.  Mississippi opposed the motion in view of the pendency of the District Court action, and also emphasized that the case was originally a dispute between private parties:  \"Houston brought the suit to establish the boundary line to their land.  It is incidental that the boundary line is also alleged to be the State line.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a.  We denied leave to file, Louisiana v. Mississippi, 488 U.S. 990, 109 S.Ct. 551, 102 L.Ed.2d 579 (1988).\n\n\n3\nThe District Court thereafter found that the thalweg, frozen by an avulsive shift in the river, was to the west of the disputed land and thus placed it within Mississippi.  Alternatively, the District Court concluded that the disputed land was part of Mississippi because \"Louisiana has acquiesced in the exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction over the island by . . . Mississippi.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a.  Having found the land to be part of Mississippi, the District Court then considered the ownership question and quieted title in the Houston Group.\n\n\n4\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the District Court's rulings both on the location of the thalweg and on acquiescence, Houston v. Thomas, 937 F.2d 247 (CA5 1991).  We granted certiorari on these two questions and on a third that we formulated:  \"Did the District Court properly assert jurisdiction over respondent's third-party complaint against petitioner State of Mississippi?\"  503 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1472, 117 L.Ed.2d 616 (1992).  We now reverse.\n\n\n5\nThe constitutional and statutory provisions necessary to our decision are these:\n\nArticle III, § 2, of the Constitution:\n\n6\n\"The judicial Power [of the United States] shall extend      . . . to Controversies between two or more States;  . . . .\n\n\n7\n\"In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public      Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be      Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.\"      Title 28 U.S.C. § 1331:  \"The district courts shall have      original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the      Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\"\n\n\n8\nTitle 28 U.S.C. § 1251(a):  \"The Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States.\"\n\n\n9\nMississippi, even though its contentions as to the boundary between itself and Louisiana were rejected by the Court of Appeals, urges us to find that the District Court had jurisdiction of the third-party complaint that Louisiana brought against it. Mississippi argues that our refusal to allow Louisiana to file an original complaint to determine the boundary between the two States must, by implication, have indicated that the District Court was a proper forum for the resolution of that question. This is particularly true, Mississippi argues, since its opposition to Louisiana's motion to file its complaint in this Court was premised in part on the contention that the boundary question could be determined in the then-pending action between the private land owners in the District Court.  Mississippi asserts that that court had jurisdiction by virtue of 28 U.S.C. § 1331, which confers jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under federal law on the District Court.\n\n\n10\nIf it were not for the existence of 28 U.S.C. § 1251(a), Mississippi's arguments would be quite plausible.  We have said more than once that our original jurisdiction should be exercised only \"sparingly.\"  See Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 789, 798, 117 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992);  Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 739, 101 S.Ct. 2114, 2125, 68 L.Ed.2d 576 (1981); Arizona v. New Mexico, 425 U.S. 794, 796, 96 S.Ct. 1845, 1846, 48 L.Ed.2d 376 (1976).  Indeed, Chief Justice Fuller wrote nearly a century ago that our original \"jurisdiction is of so delicate and grave a character that it was not contemplated that it would be exercised save when the necessity was absolute.\"  Louisiana v. Texas, 176 U.S. 1, 15, 20 S.Ct. 251, 256, 44 L.Ed. 347 (1900). Recognizing the \"delicate and grave\" character of our original jurisdiction, we have interpreted the Constitution and 28 U.S.C. § 1251(a) \"as making our original jurisdiction \"obligatory only in appropriate cases,\" Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U.S. 91, 93, 92 S.Ct. 1385, 1388, 31 L.Ed.2d 712 (1972), and as providing us \"with substantial discretion to make case-by-case judgments as to the practical necessity of an original forum in this Court,\" Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U.S. 554, 570, 103 S.Ct. 2558, 2568, 77 L.Ed.2d 1 (1983).\n\n\n11\nWe first exercised this discretion not to accept original actions in cases within our nonexclusive original jurisdiction, such as actions by States against citizens of other States, see Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U.S. 493, 91 S.Ct. 1005, 28 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971), and actions between the United States and a State, see United States v. Nevada, 412 U.S. 534, 93 S.Ct. 2763, 37 L.Ed.2d 132 (1973).  But we have since carried over its exercise to actions between two States, where our jurisdiction is exclusive.  See Arizona v. New Mexico, supra;  California v. West Virginia, 454 U.S. 1027, 102 S.Ct. 561, 70 L.Ed.2d 470 (1981); Texas v. New Mexico, supra.  Determining whether a case is \"appropriate\" for our original jurisdiction involves an examination of two factors.  First, we look to \"the nature of the interest of the complaining State,\" Massachusetts v. Missouri, 308 U.S. 1, 18, 60 S.Ct. 39, 43, 84 L.Ed. 3 (1939), focusing on the \"seriousness and dignity of the claim,\" City of Milwaukee, supra, 406 U.S., at 93, 92 S.Ct., at 1388.  \"The model case for invocation of this Court's original jurisdiction is a dispute between States of such seriousness that it would amount to casus belli if the States were fully sovereign.\"  Texas v. New Mexico, supra, 462 U.S., at 571, n. 18, 103 S.Ct., at 2569, n. 18. Second, we explore the availability of an alternative forum in which the issue tendered can be resolved.  City of Milwaukee, supra, 406 U.S., at 93, 92 S.Ct., at 1388.  In Arizona v. New Mexico, for example, we declined to exercise original jurisdiction of an action by Arizona against New Mexico challenging a New Mexico electricity tax because of a pending state-court action by three Arizona utilities challenging the same tax:  \"[W]e are persuaded that the pending state-court action provides an appropriate forum in which the issues tendered here may be litigated.\"  425 U.S., at 797, 96 S.Ct., at 1847 (emphasis in original).\n\n\n12\nBut Mississippi's argument for jurisdiction in the District Court here founders on the uncompromising language of 28 U.S.C. § 1251(a), which gives to this Court \"original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States\" (emphasis added).  Though phrased in terms of a grant of jurisdiction to this Court, the description of our jurisdiction as \"exclusive\" necessarily denies jurisdiction of such cases to any other federal court.1  This follows from the plain meaning of \"exclusive,\" see Webster's New International Dictionary 890 (2d ed. 1942) (\"debar from possession\"), and has been remarked upon by opinions in our original jurisdiction cases, e.g., California v. Arizona, 440 U.S. 59, 63, 99 S.Ct. 919, 922, 59 L.Ed.2d 144 (1979) (\"a district court could not hear [California's] claims against Arizona, because this Court has exclusive jurisdiction over such claims\").\n\n\n13\nBecause the District Court lacked jurisdiction over Louisiana's third-party complaint against Mississippi, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed insofar as it purports to grant any relief to Louisiana against Mississippi. The District Court is conceded to have had jurisdiction over the claims of the private plaintiffs against the private defendants, and in deciding questions of private title to riparian property, it may be necessary to decide where the boundary lies between the two States.  Adjudicating such a question in a dispute between private parties does not violate § 1251(a), because that section speaks not in terms of claims or issues, but in terms of parties.2  The States, of course, are not bound by any decision as to the boundary between them which was rendered in a lawsuit between private litigants.  See Durfee v. Duke, 375 U.S. 106, 115, 84 S.Ct. 242, 247, 11 L.Ed.2d 186 (1963).\n\n\n14\nBecause both the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case intermixed the questions of title to real property and of the location of the state boundary, we are not in a position to say whether on this record the claims of title may fairly be decided without additional proceedings in the District Court.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as it adjudicated the complaint filed by Louisiana against Mississippi, with instructions that it direct the District Court to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction.  We remand the balance of the case to the Court of Appeals for the necessary inquiry as to whether further proceedings are required in order to adjudicate the claims of title in this action.\n\n\n15\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.  See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.\n\n\n1\n Neither party disputes Congress's authority to make our original jurisdiction exclusive in some cases and concurrent in others.  This distinction has existed since the Judiciary Act of 1789, § 13, 1 Stat. 80-81, and has never been questioned by this Court, see Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 722, 9 L.Ed. 1233 (1838);  Ames v. Kansas, 111 U.S. 449, 469, 4 S.Ct. 437, 446, 28 L.Ed. 482 (1884).\n\n\n2\n Mississippi and Louisiana do not question the District Court's jurisdiction over Louisiana's intervention in the title dispute.  Louisiana's intervention is also unaffected by § 1251(a) because it does not seek relief against Mississippi.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

After respondent was indicted on federal drug charges, he moved to suppress the drugs recovered from the gas tank, relying on a Ninth Circuit panel decision holding that a gas tank's removal requires reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted the motion, and the Ninth Circuit summarily affirmed.\nHeld: The search did not require reasonable suspicion. In the decision relied on below, the Ninth Circuit panel seized on language from United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531, 538, that used \"routine\" as a descriptive term in discussing border searches. The panel took \"routine,\" fashioned a new balancing test, and extended it to vehicle searches. But the reasons that might support a suspicion requirement in the case of highly intrusive searches of persons simply do not carry over to vehicles. Complex balancing tests to determine what is a \"routine\" vehicle search, as opposed to a more \"intrusive\" search of a person, have no place in border searches of vehicles. The Government's interest in preventing the entry of unwanted persons and effects is at its zenith at the international border. United States v. Ramsey, 431 U. S. 606, 616. Congress has always granted the Executive plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border, without probable cause or a warrant, in order to regulate the collection of duties and to prevent the introduction of contraband into this country. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S., at 537. Respondent's assertion that he has a privacy interest in his fuel tank, and that the suspicionless disassembly of his tank is an invasion of his privacy, is rejected, as the privacy expectation is less at the border than it is in the interior, id., at 538, and this Court has long recognized that automobiles seeking entry into this country may be searched, see Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 154. And while the Fourth Amendment \"protects property as well as privacy,\" Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56, 62, the interference with a motorist's possessory interest in his gas tank is justified by the Government's paramount interest in protecting the border. Thus, the Government's authority to conduct suspicionless inspections at the border includes the authority to remove, disassemble, and reassemble a vehicle's fuel tank. Pp. 152-156.\nReversed and remanded.\nREHNQUIST, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. BREYER, J., filed a concurring opinion, post, p. 156.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\nLisa S. Blatt argued the cause for the United States. With her on the briefs were Solicitor General Olson, Assistant Attorney General Wray, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, Daniel S. Goodman, and Alfonso Robles.\nSteven F. Hubachek, by appointment of the Court, 540 U. S. 1043, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Vincent J. Brunkow and John C. Lemon.*\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nCustoms officials seized 37 kilograms — a little more than 81 pounds — of marijuana from respondent Manuel Flores-Montano's gas tank at the international border. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, relying on an earlier decision by a divided panel of that court, United States v. Molina-Tarazon, 279 F. 3d 709 (2002), held that the Fourth Amendment forbade the fuel tank search absent reasonable suspicion. No. 02-50306, 2003 WL 22410705 (Mar. 14, 2003). We hold that the search in question did not require reasonable suspicion.\n\n\n2\nRespondent, driving a 1987 Ford Taurus station wagon, attempted to enter the United States at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in southern California. A customs inspector conducted an inspection of the station wagon, and requested respondent to leave the vehicle. The vehicle was then taken to a secondary inspection station.\n\n\n3\nAt the secondary station, a second customs inspector inspected the gas tank by tapping it, and noted that the tank sounded solid. Subsequently, the inspector requested a mechanic under contract with Customs to come to the border station to remove the tank. Within 20 to 30 minutes, the mechanic arrived. He raised the car on a hydraulic lift, loosened the straps and unscrewed the bolts holding the gas tank to the undercarriage of the vehicle, and then disconnected some hoses and electrical connections. After the gas tank was removed, the inspector hammered off bondo (a putty-like hardening substance that is used to seal openings) from the top of the gas tank. The inspector opened an access plate underneath the bondo and found 37 kilograms of marijuana bricks. The process took 15 to 25 minutes.\n\n\n4\nA grand jury for the Southern District of California indicted respondent on one count of unlawfully importing marijuana, in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 952, and one count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of § 841(a)(1). Relying on Molina-Tarazon, respondent filed a motion to suppress the marijuana recovered from the gas tank. In Molina-Tarazon, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals held, inter alia, that removal of a gas tank requires reasonable suspicion in order to be consistent with the Fourth Amendment. 279 F. 3d, at 717.\n\n\n5\nThe Government advised the District Court that it was not relying on reasonable suspicion as a basis for denying respondent's suppression motion, but that it believed Molina-Tarazon was wrongly decided. The District Court, relying on Molina-Tarazon, held that reasonable suspicion was required to justify the search and, accordingly, granted respondent's motion to suppress. The Court of Appeals, citing Molina-Tarazon, summarily affirmed the District Court's judgment. No. 02-50306, 2003 WL 22410705 (CA9, Mar. 14, 2003). We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 945 (2003), and now reverse.\n\n\n6\nIn Molina-Tarazon, the Court of Appeals decided a case presenting similar facts to the one at bar. It asked \"whether [the removal and dismantling of the defendant's fuel tank] is a `routine' border search for which no suspicion whatsoever is required.\" 279 F. 3d, at 711. The Court of Appeals stated that \"[i]n order to conduct a search that goes beyond the routine, an inspector must have reasonable suspicion,\" and the \"critical factor\" in determining whether a search is \"routine\" is the \"degree of intrusiveness.\" Id., at 712-713.\n\n\n7\nThe Court of Appeals seized on language from our opinion in United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531 (1985), in which we used the word \"routine\" as a descriptive term in discussing border searches. Id., at 538 (\"Routine searches of the persons and effects of entrants are not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or warrant\"); id., at 541, n. 4 (\"Because the issues are not presented today we suggest no view on what level of suspicion, if any, is required for nonroutine border searches such as strip, body-cavity, or involuntary x-ray searches\"). The Court of Appeals took the term \"routine,\" fashioned a new balancing test, and extended it to searches of vehicles. But the reasons that might support a requirement of some level of suspicion in the case of highly intrusive searches of the person — dignity and privacy interests of the person being searched — simply do not carry over to vehicles. Complex balancing tests to determine what is a \"routine\" search of a vehicle, as opposed to a more \"intrusive\" search of a person, have no place in border searches of vehicles.\n\n\n8\nThe Government's interest in preventing the entry of unwanted persons and effects is at its zenith at the international border. Time and again, we have stated that \"searches made at the border, pursuant to the longstanding right of the sovereign to protect itself by stopping and examining persons and property crossing into this country, are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border.\" United States v. Ramsey, 431 U. S. 606, 616 (1977). Congress, since the beginning of our Government, \"has granted the Executive plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border, without probable cause or a warrant, in order to regulate the collection of duties and to prevent the introduction of contraband into this country.\" Montoya de Hernandez, supra, at 537 (citing Ramsey, supra, at 616-617 (citing Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5, 1 Stat. 29)). The modern statute that authorized the search in this case, 46 Stat. 747, 19 U. S. C. § 1581(a),1 derived from a statute passed by the First Congress, the Act of Aug. 4, 1790, ch. 35, § 31, 1 Stat. 164, see United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U. S. 579, 584 (1983), and reflects the \"impressive historical pedigree\" of the Government's power and interest, id., at 585. It is axiomatic that the United States, as sovereign, has the inherent authority to protect, and a paramount interest in protecting, its territorial integrity.\n\n\n9\nThat interest in protecting the borders is illustrated in this case by the evidence that smugglers frequently attempt to penetrate our borders with contraband secreted in their automobiles' fuel tank. Over the past 5½ fiscal years, there have been 18,788 vehicle drug seizures at the southern California ports of entry. App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a. Of those 18,788, gas tank drug seizures have accounted for 4,619 of the vehicle drug seizures, or approximately 25%. Ibid. In addition, instances of persons smuggled in and around gas tank compartments are discovered at the ports of entry of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa at a rate averaging 1 approximately every 10 days. Id., at 16a.\n\n\n10\nRespondent asserts two main arguments with respect to his Fourth Amendment interests. First, he urges that he has a privacy interest in his fuel tank, and that the suspicionless disassembly of his tank is an invasion of his privacy. But on many occasions, we have noted that the expectation of privacy is less at the border than it is in the interior. Montoya de Hernandez, supra, at 538. We have long recognized that automobiles seeking entry into this country may be searched. See Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 154 (1925) (\"Travellers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in\"). It is difficult to imagine how the search of a gas tank, which should be solely a repository for fuel, could be more of an invasion of privacy than the search of the automobile's passenger compartment.\n\n\n11\nSecond, respondent argues that the Fourth Amendment \"protects property as well as privacy,\" Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56, 62 (1992), and that the disassembly and reassembly of his gas tank is a significant deprivation of his property interest because it may damage the vehicle. He does not, and on the record cannot, truly contend that the procedure of removal, disassembly, and reassembly of the fuel tank in this case or any other has resulted in serious damage to, or destruction of, the property.2 According to the Government, for example, in fiscal year 2003, 348 gas tank searches conducted along the southern border were negative (i. e., no contraband was found), the gas tanks were reassembled, and the vehicles continued their entry into the United States without incident. Brief for United States 31.\n\n\n12\nRespondent cites not a single accident involving the vehicle or motorist in the many thousands of gas tank disassemblies that have occurred at the border. A gas tank search involves a brief procedure that can be reversed without damaging the safety or operation of the vehicle. If damage to a vehicle were to occur, the motorist might be entitled to recovery. See, e. g., 31 U. S. C. § 3723; 19 U. S. C. § 1630. While the interference with a motorist's possessory interest is not insignificant when the Government removes, disassembles, and reassembles his gas tank, it nevertheless is justified by the Government's paramount interest in protecting the border.3\n\n\n13\nFor the reasons stated, we conclude that the Government's authority to conduct suspicionless inspections at the border includes the authority to remove, disassemble, and reassemble a vehicle's fuel tank. While it may be true that some searches of property are so destructive as to require a different result, this was not one of them. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n14\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Daniel J. Popeo and Richard A. Samp filed a brief for the Washington Legal Foundation et al. as amici curiae urging reversal.\nJohn Wesley Hall, Jr., David M. Siegel, and Lisa B. Kemler filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging affirmance.\n\n\n1\n Section 1581(a) provides:\n\"Any officer of the customs may at any time go on board of any vessel or vehicle at any place in the United States or within the customs waters or, as he may be authorized, within a customs-enforcement area established under the Anti-Smuggling Act, or at any other authorized place, without as well as within his district, and examine the manifest and other documents and papers and examine, inspect, and search the vessel or vehicle and every part thereof and any person, trunk, package, or cargo on board, and to this end may hail and stop such vessel or vehicle, and use all necessary force to compel compliance.\"\n\n\n2\n Respondent's reliance on cases involving exploratory drilling searches is misplaced. SeeUnited States v. Rivas, 157 F. 3d 364 (CA5 1998) (drilling into body of trailer required reasonable suspicion); United States v. Robles, 45 F. 3d 1 (CA1 1995) (drilling into machine part required reasonable suspicion); United States v. Carreon, 872 F. 2d 1436 (CA10 1989) (drilling into camper required reasonable suspicion). We have no reason at this time to pass on the reasonableness of drilling, but simply note the obvious factual difference that this case involves the procedure of removal, disassembly, and reassembly of a fuel tank, rather than potentially destructive drilling. We again leave open the question \"whether, and under what circumstances, a border search might be deemed `unreasonable' because of the particularly offensive manner in which it is carried out.\" United States v. Ramsey, 431 U. S. 606, 618, n. 13 (1977).\n\n\n3\n Respondent also argued that he has some sort of Fourth Amendment right not to be subject to delay at the international border and that the need for the use of specialized labor, as well as the hour actual delay here and the potential for even greater delay for reassembly are an invasion of that right. Respondent points to no cases indicating the Fourth Amendment shields entrants from inconvenience or delay at the international border\nThe procedure in this case took about an hour (including the wait for the mechanic). At oral argument, the Government advised us that, depending on the type of car, a search involving the disassembly and reassembly of a gas tank may take one to two hours. Tr. of Oral Arg. 10. We think it clear that delays of one to two hours at international borders are to be expected.\n\n\n\n15\nJUSTICE BREYER, concurring.\n\n\n16\nI join the Court's opinion in full. I also note that Customs keeps track of the border searches its agents conduct, including the reasons for the searches. Tr. of Oral Arg. 53-54. This administrative process should help minimize concerns that gas tank searches might be undertaken in an abusive manner.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal with prejudice of petitioner's complaint for failure to amend his complaints pursuant to the District Court's instructions.\n\n\n2\nWe deny petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis. He is allowed until March 16, 1998, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliance with Rule 33.1. For the reasons discussed below, we also direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further  petitions for certiorari in noncriminal matters from petitioner unless he first pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner has filed 20 petitions with this Court, 16 in the past two Terms. All have been denied without recorded dissent. In 1997, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny petitioner in forma pauperis status. Arteaga v. California, 118 S. Ct. 42, 139 L. Ed. 2d 9 (1997). Petitioner nevertheless has filed another frivolous petition with this Court. In his petition and supplemental petition, Arteaga appears to assert that he is an innocent person falsely imprisoned and to allege numerous constitutional violations and conspiracies among prison, court, and government officials. He does not address the reasons for the District Court's dismissal.\n\n\n4\nAccordingly, we enter this order barring prospective in forma pauperis filings by petitioner in noncriminal cases for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1, 121 L. Ed. 2d 305, 113 S.

On February 1, 1984, before jury selection, petitioner filed a \"Motion to Prohibit the State from Using Peremptory Challenges to Strike Members of a Cognizable Group.\"  The motion recited:\n\n\n2\n\"The Accused requests of the Court that the State of Texas be      prohibited from its use of peremptory challenges to strike      prospective jurors merely based on the fact of race.  The      prosecution, the State of Texas, historically and habitually      uses its peremptory challenges to strike black people and      other minorities who are otherwise qualified.  These      peremptory challenges are exercised by the State of Texas to      strike prospective black jurors in its effort to produce an      ethnically pure, all white, jury.  This common use of the      State's peremptory challenge in a criminal trial deprives the      Accused of due process and a fair trial.  This practice      deprives the Accused of a jury representing a fair      cross-section of the community in violation of the Sixth      Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n\n3\nA hearing is requested on this Motion.\"  1A Record 280.\n\n\n4\nThe trial court delayed ruling on the motion until the voir dire.  During the course of voir dire, the prosecution exercised its peremptory challenges to excuse the only three black members of the venire.  After each of these peremptory strikes, petitioner, who is Hispanic, renewed his motion, asking that the prosecution state its reasons for striking the jurors.  The first time petitioner renewed the motion, the court stated:  \"I know of no requirement yet for either party to announce his reasons for exercising a preemptory [sic ] challenge.  Can you cite me some law on that?\"  11 Record 356.  In response, petitioner's counsel cited McCray v. Abrams, 576 F.Supp. 1244 (EDNY), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 750 F.2d 1113 (CA2 1984).  He went on to note that when we denied the petition for a writ of certiorari in McCray v. New York, 461 U.S. 961, 103 S.Ct. 2438, 77 L.Ed.2d 1322 (1983), five Justices expressed the view that Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965), ought to be reexamined.  11 Record 356.  The trial court denied petitioner's motion, and denied it again after two more black venire members were excluded.\n\n\n5\nThe all-white jury returned a verdict of guilty and after a sentencing hearing returned affirmative answers to the two special questions posed by the court.  See Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262, 267-269, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 2954-2955, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).  As required under such circumstances, see ibid., the trial court sentenced petitioner to death.  Petitioner appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, filing his brief on December 19, 1985.  This is the cause now before us.  He cited 24 errors in the guilt and punishment phases of the trial court proceedings.  The only one of concern now is the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges based on race.\n\n\n6\nPetitioner contended in the Court of Criminal Appeals that the prosecution's race based use of challenges violated his \"rights to due process of law and to an impartial jury fairly drawn from a representative cross section of the community.\" Brief for Appellant in No. 69337, p. 11.  He found these rights in \"the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\" as well as provisions of the Texas Constitution. Ibid.  He asserted he was renewing the objections pressed at trial.  Ibid.  He acknowledged that under Swain v. Alabama, the use of peremptory challenges to discriminate in a single case would not be an equal protection violation but noted that in Batson v. Kentucky, cert. granted, 471 U.S. 1052, 105 S.Ct. 2111, 85 L.Ed.2d 476 (1985), we would reconsider the question under the Sixth Amendment.  When his brief was filed, we had heard oral argument in Batson, but had not announced our decision. Petitioner urged that even if Batson did not alter the requirement of alleging an overall scheme of discrimination, the Court of Criminal Appeals should prohibit peremptory challenges based on race as a matter of state law.\n\n\n7\nOn April 30, 1986, not long after petitioner filed his brief in the Court of Criminal Appeals, our decision in Batson came down.  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69.  The case announced the now familiar rule that when a defendant makes a prima facie showing that the State has exercised its peremptory challenges to exclude members of the defendant's racial group, the State bears the burden of coming forward with a race neutral justification.  Just over a month after Batson was decided, the State filed its brief in the Court of Criminal Appeals.  The State argued Batson could not avail petitioner because he is not a member of the same race as the excluded jurors.  According to the State, petitioner's claim could not be considered an equal protection claim but was instead a claim that he was entitled to a jury composed of a \"fair cross-section\" of the community.  Brief for Appellee in No. 69337, pp. 15-17.  In drawing this distinction, the State relied on the view that a criminal defendant does not state an equal protection claim unless he alleges that the excluded jurors are members of the same protected class as he.  We rejected this view last Term in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991).\n\n\n8\nThe Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, sitting en banc, affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence on June 12, 1991, and denied petitioner's application for rehearing on September 18, 1991.  The opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals does not set forth the reason for the delay of over five years between the submission of briefs and the resolution of the appeal.  With respect to the peremptory challenge question, the court stated that the argument was foreclosed by Holland v. Illinois, 493 U.S. 474, 110 S.Ct. 803, 107 L.Ed.2d 905 (1990), in which we held that the Sixth Amendment does not prohibit the prosecution from exercising its peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors based on race.  815 S.W.2d 592, 598.  In a footnote, the Court of Criminal Appeals stated that the arguments in petitioner's brief did not amount to reliance on the Equal Protection Clause.  Id., at 598, n. 3.  The court's opinion cited neither Powers nor Ford v. Georgia, 498 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 850, 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991), which we decided on February 19, 1991.  We now grant certiorari.\n\nII\n\n9\nIn Ford v. Georgia, we addressed what steps a defendant in a criminal case was required to take to preserve an equal protection objection to the State's race based use of peremptory challenges during the pre-Batson era.  Here we consider whether petitioner took those steps.\n\n\n10\nIn Ford, the petitioner filed a pre-trial \"Motion to Restrict Racial Use of Peremptory Challenges,\" 498 U.S., at ----, 111 S.Ct., at 852, wording which is in all material respects parallel to the present petitioner's pre-trial \"Motion to Prohibit the State from Using Peremptory Challenges to Strike Members of a Cognizable Group.\"  The ultimate issue in Ford concerned the validity of a state procedural rule, but before reaching it we ruled on a preliminary issue, and that ruling is dispositive here. We stated:\n\n\n11\n\"The threshold issues are whether and, if so, when      petitioner presented the trial court with a cognizable Batson      claim that the State's exercise of its peremptory challenges      rested on the impermissible ground of race in violation of      the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  We      think petitioner must be treated as having raised such a      claim, although he certainly failed to do it with the clarity      that appropriate citations would have promoted.  The pretrial      motion made no mention of the Equal Protection Clause, and      the later motion for a new trial cited the Sixth Amendment,      not the Fourteenth.\"  Id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at      854-855.\n\n\n12\nDespite the inartfulness of the Ford petitioner's assertion of his rights, we held he had presented his claim to the trial court.  We noted that his reference in his motion to exclusion of black jurors \"over a long period of time,\" and his argument to the same effect \"could reasonably have been intended and interpreted to raise a claim under the Equal Protection Clause on the evidentiary theory articulated in Batson § antecedent, Swain v. Alabama.\"  Id., at ----, 111 S.Ct., at 855.  We placed this interpretation on the reference to history because the standard of proof for an equal protection violation under Swain required a showing of racial exclusion in \"case after case.\"  380 U.S., at 223, 85 S.Ct., at 837.\n\n\n13\nIn the matter now before us petitioner also relied on a claim of a historical pattern of discriminatory use of peremptory challenges.  That alone would have been sufficient under Ford to place the equal protection claim before the trial court.  Of course, petitioner did more.  He made an express reference to Swain in his argument to the trial court.  11 Record 356.  In fact, petitioner argued that we would modify Swain § burden of proof and that the Texas courts should anticipate our decision. We decide that petitioner presented his equal protection claim to the trial court.\n\n\n14\nWe determine further that petitioner preserved his equal protection claim before the Court of Criminal Appeals.  His argument caption made an express reference to the Fourteenth Amendment and the issue presented for review was the very one that he had raised before the trial court.\n\n\n15\nThe State in its brief to the Court of Criminal Appeals recognized that petitioner's argument contained an equal protection claim, albeit one which the State believed to lack merit.  The State did not argue that petitioner was not making an equal protection claim but that petitioner's equal protection claim had no legal support.  Given our later holding in Powers v. Ohio, supra, the State's contention is incorrect.\n\n\n16\nWe cannot ignore the fact that were we to hold petitioner had forfeited his equal protection claim by failing to state it with sufficient precision, we would be applying a stricter standard than applied in Batson itself.  There petitioner had conceded in the state courts that Swain foreclosed a direct equal protection claim, and he based his argument on the Sixth Amendment and a provision of the Kentucky Constitution.  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S., at 83, 106 S.Ct., at 1715. Yet we treated his allegation of a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment as sufficient to present the question.  Id., at 84-85, n. 4, 106 S.Ct., at 1716, n. 4.  Because petitioner's case is here on direct review, he is entitled to the rule we announced in Batson.  Compare Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987) (giving retroactive application to Batson for cases pending on direct review or not yet final when Batson was decided) with Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 296, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1067, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (denying similar application for cases on collateral review).\n\n\n17\nThe motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.  The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n18\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

We deny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8.  Jones is allowed until March 18, 1996, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1.  We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Jones in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.\n\n\n2\nJones has abused this Court's certiorari process.  In October 1992 we first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Jones in forma pauperis status in two petitions for certiorari.  See Jones v. Wright, 506 U.S. 810, 113 S.Ct. 48, 121 L.Ed.2d 16;  In re Jones, 506 U.S. 810, 113 S.Ct. 45, 121 L.Ed.2d 16.  At that time, Jones had filed over 25 petitions in this Court, all of which were patently frivolous and had been denied without recorded dissent.  And since October 1992, we have invoked Rule 39.8 five times to deny Jones in forma pauperis status.  See Jones v. Schulze, 513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 52, 130 L.Ed.2d 11 (1994);  In re Jones, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 437, 126 L.Ed.2d 371 (1993);  Jones v.

Jackson, 506 U.S. 1047, 113 S.Ct. 962, 122 L.Ed.2d 119 (1993).

District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 397, 121 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Jones' abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases and so we limit our sanction accordingly.  The order will not prevent Jones from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed against him.  The order will, however, allo w this Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.\n\n\n4\nJustice BREYER took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n6\nJustice STEVENS, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nFor the reasons I have previously expressed, I respectfully dissent.

Cochran, Jr., a California trial court found that petitioner Tory, assisted by petitioner Craft and others, had, inter alia, falsely claimed that Cochran owed him money, picketed Cochran's office with signs containing insults and obscenities, and pursued Cochran while chanting similar threats and insults, in order to coerce Cochran into paying Tory money to desist from such libelous and slanderous activity. Because Tory indicated that he would continue to engage in the activity absent a court order, the court permanently enjoined petitioners and their agents from, among other things, picketing, displaying signs, and making oral statements about Cochran and his firm in any public forum. The California Court of Appeal affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari. After oral argument, Cochran's counsel informed the Court of Cochran's death, moved to substitute Cochran's widow as respondent, and suggested that the case be dismissed as moot. Petitioners agreed to the substitution, but denied that the case was moot.\nHeld: Cochran's widow is substituted as respondent, but the case is not moot. Despite Cochran's death, the injunction remains in effect. Nothing in its language says to the contrary. Cochran's counsel argues that the injunction is still necessary, valid, and enforceable, and no source of California law says that it automatically became invalid upon Cochran's death. As this Court understands that law, a person cannot definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a court has ruled that it is. Given this uncertainty, the injunction here continues significantly to restrain petitioners' speech, thus presenting an ongoing federal controversy. Cochran's death, however, makes it unnecessary for this Court to explore petitioners' basic claims. Rather, the Court need only point out that the injunction, as written, has lost its underlying rationale. Since picketing Cochran and his law offices while engaging in injunction-forbidden speech could no longer coerce Cochran to pay for desisting in this activity, the grounds for the injunction are much diminished or have disappeared altogether. Consequently the injunction amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking plausible justification. Pp. 736-739.\nVacated and remanded.\nBREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and STEVENS, O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, SOUTER, and GINSBURG, JJ., joined. THOMAS, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which SCALIA, J., joined, post, p. 739.\nCERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA, SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT.\nErwin Chemerinsky argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Gary L. Bostwick and Jean-Paul Jassy.\nJonathan B. Cole argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Karen K. Coffin and Susan S. Baker.*\nJUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nJohnnie Cochran brought a state-law defamation action against petitioner Ulysses Tory. The state trial court determined that Tory (with the help of petitioner Ruth Craft and others) had engaged in unlawful defamatory activity. It found, for example, that Tory, while claiming falsely that Cochran owed him money, had complained to the local bar association, had written Cochran threatening letters demanding $10 million, had picketed Cochran's office holding up signs containing various insults and obscenities; and, with a group of associates, had pursued Cochran while chanting similar threats and insults. App. 38, 40-41. The court concluded that Tory's claim that Cochran owed him money was without foundation, that Tory engaged in a continuous pattern of libelous and slanderous activity, and that Tory had used false and defamatory speech to \"coerce\" Cochran into paying \"amounts of money to which Tory was not entitled\" as a \"tribute\" or a \"premium\" for \"desisting\" from this libelous and slanderous activity. Id., at 39, 42-43.\n\n\n2\nAfter noting that Tory had indicated that he would continue to engage in this activity in the absence of a court order, the Superior Court issued a permanent injunction. The injunction, among other things, prohibited Tory, Craft, and their \"agents\" or \"representatives\" from \"picketing,\" from \"displaying signs, placards or other written or printed material,\" and from \"orally uttering statements\" about Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., and about Cochran's law firm in \"any public forum.\" Id., at 34.\n\n\n3\nTory and Craft appealed. The California Court of Appeal affirmed. Tory and Craft then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, raising the following question:\n\n\n4\n\"Whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment.\" Pet. for Cert. i.\n\n\n5\nAfter oral argument, Cochran's counsel informed the Court of Johnnie Cochran's recent death. Counsel also moved to substitute Johnnie Cochran's widow, Sylvia Dale Mason Cochran, as respondent, and suggested that we dismiss the case as moot. Tory and Craft filed a response agreeing to the substitution of Ms. Cochran. But they denied that the case was moot.\n\n\n6\nWe agree with Tory and Craft that the case is not moot. Despite Johnnie Cochran's death, the injunction remains in effect. Nothing in its language says to the contrary. Cochran's counsel tells us that California law does not recognize a \"cause of action for an injury to the memory of a deceased person's reputation,\" see Kelly v. Johnson Pub. Co., 160 Cal. App. 2d 718, 325 P. 2d 659 (1958), which circumstance, counsel believes, \"moots\" a \"portion\" of the injunction (the portion \"personal to Cochran\"). Respondent's Suggestion of Death, etc., 4 (emphasis added). But counsel adds that \"[t]he [i]njunction continues to be necessary, valid and enforceable.\" Id., at 9. The parties have not identified, nor have we found, any source of California law that says the injunction here automatically becomes invalid upon Cochran's death, not even the portion personal to Cochran. Counsel also points to the \"value of\" Cochran's \"law practice\" and adds that his widow has an interest in enforcing the injunction. Id., at 11-12. And, as we understand California law, a person cannot definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a court has ruled that it is. See Mason v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 60 Cal.App.2d 587, 591, 141 P. 2d 475, 477-478 (1943) (\"[W]here the party served believes\" a court order \"invalid he should take the proper steps to have it dissolved\"); People v. Gonzalez, 12 Cal. 4th 804, 818, 910 P. 2d 1366, 1375 (1996) (\"[A] person subject to a court's injunction may elect whether to challenge the constitutional validity of the injunction when it is issued, or to reserve that claim until a violation of the injunction is charged as a contempt of court\"). Given the uncertainty of California law, we take it as a given that the injunction here continues significantly to restrain petitioners' speech, presenting an ongoing federal controversy. See, e. g., Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 486-487 (1965); NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 432-433 (1963). Consequently, we need not, and we do not, dismiss this case as moot. Cf. Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U. S. 561, 569 (1984) (case not moot in part because it appears from \"terms\" of the injunction that it is \"still in force\" and \"unless set aside must be complied with\").\n\n\n7\nAt the same time, Johnnie Cochran's death makes it unnecessary, indeed unwarranted, for us to explore petitioners' basic claims, namely, (1) that the First Amendment forbids the issuance of a permanent injunction in a defamation case, at least when the plaintiff is a public figure, and (2) that the injunction (considered prior to Cochran's death) was not properly tailored and consequently violated the First Amendment. See Brief for Petitioners ii, iii. Rather, we need only point out that the injunction, as written, has now lost its underlying rationale. Since picketing Cochran and his law offices while engaging in injunction-forbidden speech could no longer achieve the objectives that the trial court had in mind (i. e., coercing Cochran to pay a \"tribute\" for desisting in this activity), the grounds for the injunction are much diminished, if they have not disappeared altogether. Consequently the injunction, as written, now amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking plausible justification. See Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 559 (1976) (\"[P]rior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights\"); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376, 390 (1973) (a prior restraint should not \"swee[p]\" any \"more broadly than necessary\"). As such, the Constitution forbids it. See Carroll v. President and Comm'rs of Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175, 183-184 (1968) (An \"order\" issued in \"the area of First Amendment rights\" must be \"precis[e]\" and narrowly \"tailored\" to achieve the \"pin-pointed objective\" of the \"needs of the case\"); see also Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569, 575, 577 (1987) (regulation prohibiting \"all `First Amendment activities'\" substantially overbroad).\n\n\n8\nWe consequently grant the motion to substitute Sylvia Dale Mason Cochran for Johnnie Cochran as respondent. We vacate the judgment of the California Court of Appeal, and we remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. If, as the Cochran supplemental brief suggests, injunctive relief may still be warranted, any appropriate party remains free to ask for such relief. We express no view on the constitutional validity of any such new relief, tailored to these changed circumstances, should it be entered.\n\n\n9\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Briefs ofamici curiae urging reversal were filed for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations by Jonathan P.

We granted the writ, as the Court notes, to decide\n\n\n12\n\"[w]hether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment.\" Pet. for Cert. i; ante, at 736.\n\n\n13\nWhether or not Johnnie Cochran's death moots this case, it certainly renders the case an inappropriate vehicle for resolving the question presented. The Court recognizes this, ante, at 737-738, but nevertheless vacates the judgment below, ante, at 738. It does so only after deciding, as it must to exercise jurisdiction, that in light of the uncertainty in California law, the case is not moot. Ante, at 736-737; ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 621, n. 1 (1989) (when a case coming from a state court becomes moot, this Court \"lack[s] jurisdiction and thus also the power to disturb the state court's judgment\"); see also City News & Novelty, Inc. v. Waukesha, 531 U. S. 278, 283-284 (2001).\n\n\n14\nIn deciding the threshold mootness issue, a complicated problem in its own right, the Court strains to reach the validity of the injunction after Cochran's death. Whether the injunction remains valid in these changed circumstances is neither the reason we took this case nor an important question, but merely a matter of case-specific error correction. Petitioners remain free to seek relief on both constitutional and state-law grounds in the California courts. And, if the injunction is invalid, they need not obey it: California does not recognize the \"collateral bar\" rule, and thus permits collateral challenges to injunctions in contempt proceedings. People v. Gonzalez, 12 Cal. 4th 804, 818, 910 P. 2d 1366, 1375 (1996) (a person subject to an injunction may challenge \"the constitutional validity of the injunction when it is issued, or . . . reserve that claim until a violation of the injunction is charged as a contempt of court\"). The California courts can resolve the matter and, given the new state of affairs, might very well adjudge the case moot or the injunction invalid on state-law grounds rather than the constitutional grounds the Court rushes to embrace. As a prudential matter, the better course is to avoid passing unnecessarily on the constitutional question. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 345-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\n\n15\nThe Court purports to save petitioners the uncertainty of possible enforcement of the injunction, and thereby to prevent any chill on their First Amendment rights, by vacating the judgment below. But what the Court gives with the left hand it takes with the right, for it only invites further litigation by pronouncing that \"injunctive relief may still be warranted,\" conceding that \"any appropriate party remains free to ask for such relief,\" and \"express[ing] no view on the constitutional validity of any such new relief.\" Ante, at 738-739. What the Court means by \"any appropriate party\" is unclear. Perhaps the Court means Sylvia Dale Mason Cochran, Cochran's widow, who has taken his place in this suit. Or perhaps it means the Cochran firm, which has never been a party to this case, but may now (if \"appropriate\") intervene and attempt to enjoin the defamation of a now-deceased third party. The Court's decision invites the doubts it seeks to avoid. Its decision is unnecessary and potentially self-defeating. The more prudent course is to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.

P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 34, App. II, Rule 23 (1991).  A neutral magistrate presides over the hearing, People v. Opio Opio, 104 P.R.R. (4 Official Translations 231, 239) (1975), for which the defendant has the rights to appear and to counsel.  Rule 23(a)-(b).  Both the prosecution and the defendant may introduce evidence and cross-examine witnesses, Rule 23(c), and the defendant may present certain affirmative defenses.  People v. Lebron Lebron, 116 P.R.R. (16 Official Translations 1052, 1058) (1986).  The magistrate must determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the offense charged. Rule 23(c) provides that the hearing \"shall be held privately\" unless the defendant requests otherwise.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner Jose Purcell is a reporter for petitioner El Vocero de Puerto Rico, the largest newspaper in the Commonwealth. By written request to respondents District Judges, he sought to attend preliminary hearings over which they were to preside.  In the alternative, he sought access to recordings of the hearings. After these requests were denied, petitioners brought this action in Puerto Rico Superior Court seeking a declaration that the privacy provision of Rule 23(c) violates the First Amendment, applicable to the Commonwealth through the Fourteenth Amendment,1 and an injunction against its enforcement.  Petitioners based their claim on Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of California, Riverside County, 478 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986), which addressed a California law that allowed magistrates to close preliminary hearings quite similar in form and function to those held under Rule 23 if it was reasonably likely that the defendant's ability to obtain a fair hearing would be prejudiced.  Id., at 12, 14, 106 S.Ct., at 2742, 2743. Applying the \"tests of experience and logic,\" id., at 9, 106 S.Ct., at 2740, of Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court of Norfolk County, 457 U.S. 596, 102 S.Ct. 2613, 73 L.Ed.2d 248 (1982), Press-Enterprise struck down the California privacy law on the grounds that preliminary criminal hearings have traditionally been public, and because the hearings at issue were \"sufficiently like a trial,\" 478 U.S., at 12, 106 S.Ct., at 2742, that public access was \"essential to the[ir] proper functioning. . . .\"  Ibid.\n\n\n3\nIn affirming the dismissal of petitioners' suit, a divided Supreme Court of Puerto Rico found that Press-Enterprise did not control the outcome because of several differences between Rule 23 hearings and the California hearings at issue there.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 129.2  It thus proceeded to determine the constitutionality of Rule 23 hearings by application anew of the Globe Newspaper tests.  The court concluded that closed hearings are compatible with the unique history and traditions of the Commonwealth, which display a special concern for the honor and reputation of the citizenry, and that open hearings would prejudice defendants' ability to obtain fair trials because of Puerto Rico's small size and dense population.\n\n\n4\nThe decision below is irreconcilable with Press-Enterprise: for precisely the reasons stated in that decision, the privacy provision of Rule 23(c) is unconstitutional.3  The distinctions drawn by the court below are insubstantial.  In fact, each of the features cited by Press-Enterprise in support of the finding that California's preliminary hearings were \"sufficiently like a trial\" to require public access is present here.  Rule 23 hearings are held before a neutral magistrate;  the accused is afforded the rights to counsel, to cross-examination, to present testimony, and, at least in some instances, to suppress illegally seized evidence;4  the accused is bound over for trial only upon the magistrate's finding probable cause;  in a substantial portion of criminal cases, the hearing provides the only occasion for public observation of the criminal justice system;5  and no jury is present.  Cf. 478 U.S., at 12-13, 106 S.Ct., at 2742-2743.\n\n\n5\nNor are these commonalities coincidental:  as the majority noted, the Rule's drafters relied on the California law at issue in Press-Enterprise as one source of Rule 23.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 93, n. 26.  At best, the distinctive features of Puerto Rico's preliminary hearing render it a subspecies of the provision this Court found to be infirm seven years ago.  Beyond this, however, the privacy provision of Rule 23(c) is more clearly suspect.  California law allowed magistrates to close hearings only upon a determination that there was a substantial likelihood of prejudice to the defendant, yet the Press-Enterprise Court found this standard insufficiently exacting to protect public access.  478 U.S., at 14-15, 106 S.Ct. at 2743-2744.  By contrast, Rule 23 provides no standard, allowing hearings to be closed upon the request of the defendant, without more.\n\n\n6\nThe Puerto Rico Supreme Court's reliance on Puerto Rican tradition is also misplaced.  As the First Circuit Court of Appeals has correctly stated, the \"experience\" test of Globe Newspaper does not look to the particular practice of any one jurisdiction, but instead \"to the experience in that type or kind of hearing throughout the United States. . . .\"  Rivera-Puig v. Garcia-Rosario, 983 F.2d 311, 323 (1992) (emphasis in original). The established and widespread tradition of open preliminary hearings among the States was canvassed in Press-Enterprise and is controlling here.  478 U.S., at 10-11, and nn. 3-4, 106 S.Ct., at 2741-2742, and nn. 3-4.\n\n\n7\nThe concern of the majority below that publicity will prejudice defendants' fair trial rights is, of course, legitimate.  But this concern can and must be addressed on a case-by-case basis:\n\n\n8\n\"If the interest asserted is the right of the accused to a      fair trial, the preliminary hearing shall be closed only if      specific findings are made demonstrating that, first, there      is a substantial probability that the defendant's right to a      fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would      prevent and, second, reasonable alternatives to closure      cannot adequately protect the defendant's fair trial rights.\"      Id., at 14, 106 S.Ct., at 2743.\n\n\n9\nThe petition for certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is\n\n\n10\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n1\n The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment fully applies to Puerto Rico.  Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 331, n. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2968, 2971, n. 1, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986).\n\n\n2\n Specifically, the court addressed the Commonwealth's burden of proof, the rules governing the parties' access to, and presentation of, certain evidence, the fact that an indictment follows, rather than precedes, the preliminary hearing, and the ability of the prosecution to present the matter de novo before a higher court in cases where the magistrate finds no probable cause.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 112-129.\n\n\n3\n The First Circuit Court of Appeals has since found this provision unconstitutional.  See Rivera-Puig v. Garcia-Rosario, 983 F.2d 311 (1992).\n\n\n4\n The admissibility of illegally-seized evidence apparently is an open question in Puerto Rico law.

KAREN BARKES, ET AL.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 14–939.   Decided June 1, 2015\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Christopher Barkes, “a troubled man with a long history\nof mental health and substance abuse problems,” was\narrested on November 13, 2004, for violating his proba-\ntion. Barkes v. First Correctional Medical, Inc., 766 F.3d\n307, 310–311 (CA3 2014). Barkes was taken to the How-\nard R. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington,\nDelaware. As part of Barkes’s intake, a nurse who worked\nfor the contractor providing healthcare at the Institution\nconducted a medical evaluation. Id., at 311.\n   The evaluation included a mental health screening\ndesigned in part to assess whether an inmate was suicidal.\nThe nurse employed a suicide screening form based on a\nmodel form developed by the National Commission on\nCorrectional Health Care (NCCHC) in 1997. The form\nlisted 17 suicide risk factors. If the inmate’s responses\nand nurse’s observations indicated that at least eight were\npresent, or if certain serious risk factors were present, the\nnurse would notify a physician and initiate suicide preven-\ntion measures. Id., at 311, 313.\n   Barkes disclosed that he had a history of psychiatric\ntreatment and was on medication. He also disclosed that\nhe had attempted suicide in 2003, though not—as far as\nthe record indicates—that he had also done so on three\nother occasions. And he indicated that he was not cur-\nrently thinking about killing himself. Because only two risk\nfactors were apparent, the nurse gave Barkes a “routine”\nreferral to mental health services and did not initiate any\nspecial suicide prevention measures. Id., at 311.\n2                    TAYLOR v. BARKES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   Barkes was placed in a cell by himself. Despite what he\nhad told the nurse, that evening he called his wife and told\nher that he “can’t live this way anymore” and was going to\nkill himself. Barkes’s wife did not inform anyone at the\nInstitution of this call. The next morning, correctional\nofficers observed Barkes awake and behaving normally at\n10:45, 10:50, and 11:00 a.m. At 11:35 a.m., however, an\nofficer arrived to deliver lunch and discovered that Barkes\nhad hanged himself with a sheet. Id., at 311–312.\n   Barkes’s wife and children, respondents here, brought\nsuit under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U.S. C. §1983, against\nvarious entities and individuals connected with the Insti-\ntution, who they claimed had violated Barkes’s civil rights\nin failing to prevent his suicide. At issue here is a claim\nagainst petitioners Stanley Taylor, Commissioner of the\nDelaware Department of Correction (DOC), and Raphael\nWilliams, the Institution’s warden. Although it is undis-\nputed that neither petitioner had personally interacted\nwith Barkes or knew of his condition before his death,\nrespondents alleged that Taylor and Williams had violated\nBarkes’s constitutional right to be free from cruel and\nunusual punishment. Barkes v. First Correctional Medi-\ncal, Inc., 2008 WL 523216, *7 (D Del., Feb. 27, 2008).\nThey did so, according to respondents, by failing to super-\nvise and monitor the private contractor that provided the\nmedical treatment—including the intake screening—at\nthe Institution. Petitioners moved for summary judgment\non the ground that they were entitled to qualified immu-\nnity, but the District Court denied the motion. Barkes v.\nFirst Correctional Medical, Inc., 2012 WL 2914915, *8–*12\n(D Del., July 17, 2012).\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit affirmed. The majority first determined that\nrespondents had alleged a cognizable theory of supervisory\nliability (a decision upon which we express no view). 766\nF.3d, at 316–325. The majority then turned to the two-\n                 Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nstep qualified immunity inquiry, asking “first, whether the\nplaintiff suffered a deprivation of a constitutional or stat-\nutory right; and second, if so, whether that right was\n‘clearly established’ at the time of the alleged misconduct.”\nId., at 326.\n   Taking these questions in reverse order, the Third\nCircuit held that it was clearly established at the time of\nBarkes’s death that an incarcerated individual had an\nEighth Amendment “right to the proper implementation of\nadequate suicide prevention protocols.” Id., at 327. The\npanel majority then concluded there were material factual\ndisputes about whether petitioners had violated this right\nby failing to adequately supervise the contractor providing\nmedical services at the prison. There was evidence, the\nmajority noted, that the medical contractor’s suicide\nscreening process did not comply with NCCHC’s latest\nstandards, as required by the contract. Those standards\nallegedly called for a revised screening form and for\nscreening by a qualified mental health professional, not a\nnurse. There was also evidence that the contractor did not\nhave access to Barkes’s probation records (which would\nhave shed light on his mental health history), and that the\ncontractor had been short-staffing to increase profits. Id.,\nat 330–331.\n   Judge Hardiman dissented. As relevant here, he con-\ncluded that petitioners were entitled to qualified immu-\nnity because the right on which the majority relied was “a\ndeparture from Eighth Amendment case law that had\nnever been established before today.” Id., at 345.\n   Taylor and Williams petitioned for certiorari. We grant\nthe petition and reverse on the ground that there was no\nviolation of clearly established law.\n   “Qualified immunity shields government officials from\ncivil damages liability unless the official violated a statu-\ntory or constitutional right that was clearly established at\nthe time of the challenged conduct.” Reichle v. Howards,\n4                    TAYLOR v. BARKES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5). “To be clearly\nestablished, a right must be sufficiently clear that every\nreasonable official would have understood that what he is\ndoing violates that right.” Ibid. (brackets and internal\nquotation marks omitted). “When properly applied, [quali-\nfied immunity] protects all but the plainly incompetent or\nthose who knowingly violate the law.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). “We do not require a case directly on\npoint, but existing precedent must have placed the statu-\ntory or constitutional question beyond debate.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 9).\n   The Third Circuit concluded that the right at issue was\nbest defined as “an incarcerated person’s right to the\nproper implementation of adequate suicide prevention\nprotocols.” 766 F.3d, at 327. This purported right, how-\never, was not clearly established in November 2004 in a\nway that placed beyond debate the unconstitutionality of\nthe Institution’s procedures, as implemented by the medi-\ncal contractor.\n   No decision of this Court establishes a right to the\nproper implementation of adequate suicide prevention pro-\ntocols. No decision of this Court even discusses suicide\nscreening or prevention protocols. And “to the extent that\na ‘robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority’ ” in\nthe Courts of Appeals “could itself clearly establish the\nfederal right respondent alleges,” City and County of San\nFrancisco v. Sheehan, 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at\n16), the weight of that authority at the time of Barkes’s\ndeath suggested that such a right did not exist. See, e.g.,\nComstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 702 (CA6 2001) (“the\nright to medical care for serious medical needs does not\nencompass the right to be screened correctly for suicidal\ntendencies” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Tittle v.\nJefferson Cty. Comm’n, 10 F.3d 1535, 1540 (CA11 1994)\n(alleged “weaknesses in the [suicide] screening process,\n                  Cite as: 575 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthe training of deputies[,] and the supervision of prison-\ners” did not “amount to a showing of deliberate indiffer-\nence toward the rights of prisoners”); Burns v. Galveston,\n905 F.2d 100, 104 (CA5 1990) (rejecting the proposition\nthat “the right of detainees to adequate medical care\nincludes an absolute right to psychological screening”);\nBelcher v. Oliver, 898 F.2d 32, 34–35 (CA4 1990) (“The\ngeneral right of pretrial detainees to receive basic medical\ncare does not place upon jail officials the responsibility to\nscreen every detainee for suicidal tendencies.”).\n   The Third Circuit nonetheless found this right clearly\nestablished by two of its own decisions, both stemming\nfrom the same case. Assuming for the sake of argument\nthat a right can be “clearly established” by circuit prece-\ndent despite disagreement in the courts of appeals, neither\nof the Third Circuit decisions relied upon clearly estab-\nlished the right at issue. The first, Colburn I, said that if\nofficials “know or should know of the particular vulner-\nability to suicide of an inmate,” they have an obligation “not\nto act with reckless indifference to that vulnerability.”\nColburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 838 F.2d 663, 669 (1988).\nThe decision did not say, however, that detention facilities\nmust implement procedures to identify such vulnerable\ninmates, let alone specify what procedures would suffice.\nAnd the Third Circuit later acknowledged that Colburn I ’s\nuse of the phrase “or should know”—which might seem to\nnod toward a screening requirement of some kind—was\nerroneous in light of Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825\n(1994), which held that Eighth Amendment liability re-\nquires actual awareness of risk. See Serafin v. Johnstown,\n53 Fed. Appx. 211, 213 (CA3 2002).\n   Nor would Colburn II have put petitioners on notice of\nany possible constitutional violation. Colburn II reiter-\nated that officials who know of an inmate’s particular vul-\nnerability to suicide must not be recklessly indifferent to\nthat vulnerability. Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 946\n6                   TAYLOR v. BARKES\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nF. 2d 1017, 1023 (1991). But it did not identify any mini-\nmum screening procedures or prevention protocols that\nfacilities must use. In fact, Colburn II revealed that the\nbooking process of the jail at issue “include[d] no formal\nphysical or mental health screening,” ibid., and yet the\nThird Circuit ruled for the defendants on all claims, see\nid., at 1025–1031.\n  In short, even if the Institution’s suicide screening and\nprevention measures contained the shortcomings that\nrespondents allege, no precedent on the books in Novem-\nber 2004 would have made clear to petitioners that they\nwere overseeing a system that violated the Constitution.\nBecause, at the very least, petitioners were not contraven-\ning clearly established law, they are entitled to qualified\nimmunity. The judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed.\n\n                                           It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Gaydos seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis and requests this Court to issue a writ of mandamus ordering (1) the Clerk of the District Court for the District of New Jersey to file her Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit challenging this Court's orders in 10 previous cases in which Gaydos was denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis under this Court's Rule 39.8;* (2) the disqualification of William T. Walsh, Clerk of the District Court, and William K.  Suter, Clerk of this Court;  and (3) the issuance of summons under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4. In the alternative, she asks this Court to exercise its original jurisdiction over her FOIA suit because her complaint concerns this Court's orders.\n\n\n2\nWe deny petitioner's requests.  Petitioner is allowed until December 23, 1996, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit her petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.  For the reasons discussed below, we direct the Clerk  of the Court not to accept any further petitions for certiorari or for extraordinary writs in noncriminal matters from petitioner unless she first pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits her petition in compliance with Rul e 33.1.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner has a history of frivolous, repetitive filings. She has been denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis 10 times, and she has filed at least 8 other petitions.  This most recent petition is nearly incomprehensible, and alludes to, among other things, fraud by the staff of this Court and impending impeachment proceedings against Clerks Walsh and Suter in the House of Representatives.  We also note that the relief she purports to seek has already been granted:  The District Court docketed petitioner's FOIA complaint as Case No. 96-CV-42435 on September 9, 1996, and promptly dismissed it ''in its entirety''  the following week.\n\n\n4\nWe enter the order barring future in forma pauperis filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 397, 121 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Because petitioner has limited her abuse of our processes to noncriminal cases, we limit our sanction accordingly.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n6\nJustice STEVENS, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nFor reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1, 4, 113 S.Ct. 397, 398, 121 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), and cases cited, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n*\n Rule 39.8 provides:  ''If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari, jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary writ  . . .  is frivolous or malicious, the Court may deny a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.

UNITED STATES(97-9217)142 F.3d 430, affirmed.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES119 S.Ct. 961143 L.Ed.2d 18\nNo. 97 9217\n\nMANUEL DeJESUS PEGUERO, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n[March 2, 1999]\nJustice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict over whether a district court's failure to advise a defendant of his right to appeal as required by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides a basis for collateral relief even when the defendant was aware of his right to appeal when the trial court omitted to give the advice. Compare, e.g., Thompson v. United States, 111 F.3d 109 (CA11 1997) (defendant entitled to relief even if he knew of his right to appeal through other sources); United States v. Sanchez, 88 F.3d 1243 (CADC 1996) (same); Reid v. United States, 69 F.3d 688 (CA2 1995) (per curiam) (same), with Tress v. United States, 87 F.3d 188 (CA7 1996) (defendant not entitled to relief if he knew of his right to appeal); United States v. Drummond, 903 F.2d 1171 (CA8 1990) (same). We hold that a district court's failure to advise the defendant of his right to appeal does not entitle him to habeas relief if he knew of his right and hence suffered no prejudice from the omission.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner Manuel Peguero pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. At a sentencing hearing held on April 22, 1992, the District Court sentenced petitioner to 274 months' imprisonment. The court did not inform petitioner of his right to appeal his sentence.\n\n\n3\nIn December of 1996, more than four years after he was sentenced, petitioner filed a pro se motion to set aside his conviction and sentence. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. II). He alleged his counsel was ineffective for various reasons, including the failure to file a notice of appeal pursuant to petitioner's request. App. 63, 65. The District Court appointed new counsel, who filed an amended motion adding a claim that at the sentencing proceeding the trial court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a)(2) by failing to advise petitioner of his right to appeal his sentence. This last claim gives rise to the question before us.\n\n\n4\nThe District Court held an evidentiary hearing. Petitioner testified that, upon being sentenced, he at once asked his lawyer to file an appeal. App. 139. Consistent with petitioner's testimony, the District Court found that, although the sentencing court had failed to advise petitioner of his right to appeal the sentence, petitioner knew of his right to appeal when the sentencing hearing occurred. No. 1:CR 90 97 01 (MD Pa., July 1, 1997), App. 168, 184. The court also credited the testimony of petitioner's trial counsel that petitioner told counsel he did not want to take an appeal because he hoped to cooperate with the Government and earn a sentence reduction. Id., at 180 181; cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b) (\"The court, on motion of the Government made within one year after the imposition of the sentence, may reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense\").\n\n\n5\nRelying on our holding in United States v. Timmreck, 441 U.S. 780 (1979), the District Court rejected petitioner's claim that any violation of Rule 32, without regard to prejudice, is enough to vacate a sentence under §2255. The court held that petitioner was not entitled to relief because he was actually aware of his right to appeal at the time of sentencing. No. 1:CR 90 97 01, App. 184. The court also rejected petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on its finding that petitioner did not request an appeal. Id., at 180.\n\n\n6\nThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the ruling. It held that the Rule 32(a)(2) violation was subject to harmless-error review and that, because petitioner was aware of his right to appeal, the purpose of the Rule had been served and petitioner was not entitled to relief. Judgt. order reported at 142 F.3d 430 (1998), App. 192, 194 195.\n\n\n7\nIn 1992, when petitioner was sentenced, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a)(2) provided:\n\n\n8\n\"Notification of Right To Appeal. After imposing sentence in a case which has gone to trial on a plea of not guilty, the court shall advise the defendant of the defendant's right to appeal, including any right to appeal the sentence, and of the right of a person who is unable to pay the cost of an appeal to apply for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. There shall be no duty on the court to advise the defendant of any right of appeal after sentence is imposed following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,  except that the court shall advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence. If the defendant so requests, the clerk of the court shall prepare and file forthwith a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant.\"\n\n\n9\nCurrent Rule 32(c)(5) likewise imposes on the district court the duty to advise the defendant at sentencing of any right to appeal.\n\n\n10\nThe requirement that the district court inform a defendant of his right to appeal serves important functions. It will often be the case that, as soon as sentence is imposed, the defendant will be taken into custody and transported elsewhere, making it difficult for the defendant to maintain contact with his attorney. The relationship between the defendant and the attorney may also be strained after sentencing, in any event, because of the defendant's disappointment over the outcome of the case or the terms of the sentence. The attorney, moreover, concentrating on other matters, may fail to tell the defendant of the right to appeal, though months later the attorney may think that he in fact gave the advice because it was standard practice to do so. In addition, if the defendant is advised of the right by the judge who imposes sentence, the defendant will realize that the appeal may be taken as of right and without affront to the trial judge, who may later rule upon a motion to modify or reduce the sentence. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35. Advising the defendant of his right at sentencing also gives him a clear opportunity to announce his intention to appeal and request the court clerk to file the notice of appeal, well before the 10-day filing period runs. See Rule 32(c)(5) (\"If the defendant so requests, the clerk of the court must immediately prepare and file a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant\"); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b) (establishing 10-day period for filing appeal, which may be extended for 30 days by district court for \"excusable neglect\").\n\n\n11\nThese considerations underscore the importance of the advice which comes from the court itself. Trial judges must be meticulous and precise in following each of the requirements of Rule 32 in every case. It is undisputed, then, that the court's failure to give the required advice was error.\n\n\n12\nA violation of Rule 32(a)(2), however, does not entitle a defendant to collateral relief in all circumstances. Our precedents establish, as a general rule, that a court's failure to give a defendant advice required by the Federal Rules is a sufficient basis for  collateral relief only when the defendant is prejudiced by the court's error. In Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424 (1962), for example, the District Court violated the then-applicable version of Rule 32(a) by failing to make explicit that the defendant had an opportunity to speak in his own behalf. The defendant did not allege that he had been \"affirmatively denied an opportunity to speak,\" that the District Judge had been deprived of any relevant information, or that the defendant \"would have had anything at all to say if he had been formally invited to speak.\" Id., at 429. The defendant established only \"a failure to comply with the formal requirements of the Rule,\" ibid., and alleged no prejudice; on these premises, the Court held the defendant was not entitled to collateral relief, id., at 428 429.\n\n\n13\nSo, also, in United States v. Timmreck, collateral relief was unavailable to a defendant who alleged only that the District Court \" 'fail[ed] to comply with the formal requirements' \" of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by not advising him of a mandatory special parole term to which he was subject. 441 U.S., at 785. The defendant did not argue \"that he was actually unaware of the special parole term or that, if he had been properly advised by the trial judge, he would not have pleaded guilty.\" Id., at 784. Having alleged no prejudice, defendant's \"only claim [was] of a technical violation of the Rule\" insufficient to justify habeas relief. Ibid.\n\n\n14\nIn this case, petitioner had full knowledge of his right to appeal, hence the District Court's violation of Rule 32(a)(2) by failing to inform him of that right did not prejudice him. The fact of the violation, standing alone, Hill and Timmreck instruct, does not entitle petitioner to collateral relief.\n\n\n15\nOur decision in Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U.S. 327 (1969), does not hold otherwise. In Rodriquez, the Court held that when counsel fails to file a requested appeal, a defendant is entitled to resentencing and to an appeal without showing that his appeal would likely have had merit. Id., at 329 330. Without questioning the rule in Rodriquez, we conclude its holding is not implicated here because of the District Court's factual finding that petitioner did not request an appeal. While Rodriquez did note the sentencing court's failure to advise the defendant of his right to appeal, it did so only in the course of rejecting the Government's belated argument that the case should be remanded for factfinding to  determine the reason counsel had not filed the appeal. The court's failure to advise the defendant of his right was simply one factor in combination with the untimeliness of the Government's request and the lengthy proceedings and delay the defendant had already endured that led the Court to conclude that it was \"just under the circumstances\" to accord the petitioner final relief at that time without further proceedings. Id., at 331 332. This limited and fact-specific conclusion does not support a general rule that a court's failure to advise a defendant of the right to appeal automatically requires resentencing to allow an appeal.\n\n\n16\nPetitioner and his amicus would distinguish Timmreck (and, presumably, Hill) on the ground that the defendant in Timmreck had the opportunity to raise his claim on direct appeal but failed to do so, whereas the absence of the \"judicial warning [required by Rule 32(a)(2)] may effectively undermine the defendant's ability to take a direct appeal.\" Brief for Petitioner 20. This argument, however, provides no basis for holding that a Rule 32(a)(2) oversight, though nonprejudicial, automatically entitles the defendant to habeas relief. Even errors raised on direct appeal are subject to harmless-error review. Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure prohibits federal courts from granting relief based on errors that \"d[o] not affect substantial rights.\" See Rule 52(a) (\"Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded\"); see also Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 254 255 (1988) (\"[A] federal court may not invoke supervisory power to circumvent the harmless-error inquiry prescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a)  . Rule 52 is, in every pertinent respect, as binding as any statute duly enacted by Congress, and federal courts have no more discretion to disregard the Rule's mandate than they do to disregard constitutional or statutory provisions\").\n\n\n17\nAccordingly, we hold that petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief based on a Rule 32(a)(2) violation when he had independent knowledge of the right to appeal and so was not prejudiced by the trial court's omission. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is\n\n\n18\nAffirmed.\n\nO'Connor, J., concurring\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nNo. 97 9217\n\n19\nMANUEL DeJESUS PEGUERO, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n20\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n\n21\n[March 2, 1999]\n\n\n22\nJustice O'Connor, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring.\n\n\n23\nI join the opinion of the Court, and I write separately to express my views about the meaning of prejudice in this context. When, as here, a district court fails to advise a defendant of his right to appeal, there are two ways in which this error could be said not to have prejudiced the defendant. First, a defendant might not be prejudiced by the error because he already knew about his right to appeal. That is the case here, and the Court properly concludes that under these circumstances, the defendant has not shown that he is entitled to collateral relief.\n\n\n24\nSecond, a defendant might not be prejudiced by the district court's failure to advise him of his right to appeal because he had no meritorious grounds for appeal in any event. In my opinion, there is no reason why a defendant should have to demonstrate that he had meritorious grounds for an appeal when he is attempting to show that he was harmed by the district court's error. To require defendants to specify the grounds for their appeal and show that they have some merit would impose a heavy burden on defendants who are often proceeding pro se in an initial 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion. If the district judge had fulfilled his obligation to advise the defendant of his right to appeal, and the defendant had wanted to appeal, he would have had a lawyer to identify and develop his arguments on appeal. The defendant should not be penalized for failing to appeal in the first instance when his failure to appeal is attributable to the errors of a district court judge. This result is consistent with our resolution of Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U.S. 327 (1969). In Rodriquez, we held that when a defendant's failure to appeal a conviction is attributable to an error by his lawyer, the defendant is entitled to collateral relief without requiring him to show that his appeal would have had merit. In my view, there is no reason to adopt a different rule when the failure to appeal results from a district judge's error.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Decided January 24, 2011\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n                               I\n   California’s parole statute provides that the Board of\nPrison Terms “shall set a release date unless it determines\nthat . . . consideration of the public safety requires a more\nlengthy period of incarceration.” Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§3041(b) (West Supp. 2010). If the Board denies parole,\nthe prisoner can seek judicial review in a state habeas\npetition. The California Supreme Court has explained\nthat “the standard of review properly is characterized as\nwhether ‘some evidence’ supports the conclusion that the\ninmate is unsuitable for parole because he or she currently\nis dangerous.” In re Lawrence, 44 Cal. 4th 1181, 1191, 190\nP.3d 535, 539 (2008). See also In re Shaputis, 44 Cal. 4th\n1241, 1253–1254, 190 P.3d 573, 580 (2008); In re Rosen\nkrantz, 29 Cal. 4th 616, 625–626, 59 P.3d 174, 183 (2002).\n                              A\n   Respondent Damon Cooke was convicted of attempted\nfirst-degree murder in 1991, and a California court sen\ntenced him to an indeterminate term of seven years to life\nin prison with the possibility of parole. In November 2002,\nthe board determined that Cooke was not yet suitable for\nparole, basing its decision on the “especially cruel and\ncallous manner” of his commitment offense, App. to Pet.\n2                  SWARTHOUT v. COOKE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nfor Cert. 50a; his failure to participate fully in rehabilita\ntive programs; his failure to develop marketable skills;\nand three incidents of misconduct while in prison. The\nboard admitted that Cooke had received a favorable psy\nchological report, but it dismissed the report as not credi\nble because it included several inconsistent and erroneous\nstatements.\n   Cooke filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nState Superior Court. The court denied his petition. “The\nrecord indicates,” it said, “that there was some evidence,\nincluding but certainly not limited to the life offense, to\nsupport the board’s denial.” Id., at 42a. Cooke subse\nquently filed a habeas petition with the California Court of\nAppeal and a petition for direct review by the California\nSupreme Court. Both were denied.\n   In October 2004, Cooke filed a federal habeas petition\npursuant to 28 U.S. C. §2254 challenging the parole\nboard’s determination. The District Court denied his\npetition. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Cali\nfornia’s parole statute created a liberty interest protected\nby the Due Process Clause, and that “California’s ‘some\nevidence’ requirement” was a “component” of that feder\nally protected liberty interest. Cooke v. Solis, 606 F.3d\n1206, 1213 (2010). It then concluded that the state court\nhad made an “unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence” under §2254(d)(2) by finding any\nevidence at all that Cooke would pose a threat to public\nsafety if released. Id., at 1215.\n                            B\n  Respondent Elijah Clay was convicted of first-degree\nmurder in 1978, and a California court sentenced him to\nimprisonment for seven years to life with the possibility of\nparole. In 2003, the board found Clay suitable for parole,\nbut the Governor exercised his authority to review the\ncase and found Clay unsuitable for parole. See Cal.\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nConst., Art. 5, §8(b); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §3041.2 (West\n2000). The Governor cited the gravity of Clay’s crime;\nhis extensive criminal history, which reflected “the culmi\nnation of a life of crime,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a;\nhis failure to participate fully in self-help programs; and his\nunrealistic plans for employment and housing after being\nparoled. Regarding the last factor, the Governor con\ncluded that Clay would be likely to return to crime, given\nhis propensity for substance abuse and lack of a viable\nmeans of employment.\n  Clay filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State\nSuperior Court. That court denied Clay’s petition, as did\nthe California Court of Appeal. The California Supreme\nCourt denied review.\n  Clay subsequently filed a federal petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus, which the District Court granted. The\nDistrict Court concluded that the Governor’s reliance on\nthe nature of Clay’s long-past commitment offense vio\nlated Clay’s right to due process, and dismissed each of\nthe other factors the Governor cited as unsupported by the\nrecord. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion that “the Governor’s decision\nwas an unreasonable application of California’s ‘some\nevidence’ rule and was an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented.” Clay v. Kane,\n384 Fed. Appx. 544, 546 (2010).\n                              II\n  In granting habeas relief based on its conclusion that\nthe state courts had misapplied California’s “some evi\ndence” rule, the Ninth Circuit must have assumed either\nthat federal habeas relief is available for an error of state\nlaw, or that correct application of the State’s “some evi\ndence” standard is required by the federal Due Process\nClause. Neither assumption is correct.\n  As to the first: The habeas statute “unambiguously\n4                  SWARTHOUT v. COOKE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nprovides that a federal court may issue a writ of habeas\ncorpus to a state prisoner ‘only on the ground that he is in\ncustody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties\nof the United States.’ ” Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (quoting 28 U.S. C.\n§2254(a)). “We have stated many times that ‘federal\nhabeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.’ ”\nEstelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis\nv. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990)).\n   As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under\nthat provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether\nthere exists a liberty or property interest of which a per\nson has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the\nprocedures followed by the State were constitutionally\nsufficient. Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490\nU.S. 454, 460 (1989). Here, the Ninth Circuit held that\nCalifornia law creates a liberty interest in parole, see 606\nF.3d, at 1213. While we have no need to review that\nholding here, it is a reasonable application of our cases.\nSee Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369, 373–381\n(1987); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correc\ntional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 12 (1979).\n   Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, a state\ninterest created by California law. There is no right under\nthe Federal Constitution to be conditionally released\nbefore the expiration of a valid sentence, and the States\nare under no duty to offer parole to their prisoners. Id., at\n7. When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the\nDue Process Clause requires fair procedures for its vindi\ncation—and federal courts will review the application of\nthose constitutionally required procedures. In the context\nof parole, we have held that the procedures required are\nminimal. In Greenholtz, we found that a prisoner subject\nto a parole statute similar to California’s received ade\nquate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be\nheard and was provided a statement of the reasons why\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nparole was denied. 442 U.S., at 16. “The Constitution,”\nwe held, “does not require more.” Ibid. Cooke and Clay\nreceived at least this amount of process: They were al\nlowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the\nevidence against them, were afforded access to their re\ncords in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why\nparole was denied. 606 F.3d, at 1208–1212; App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 69a–80a; Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§3041, 3041.5\n(West Supp. 2010).\n  That should have been the beginning and the end of the\nfederal habeas courts’ inquiry into whether Cooke and\nClay received due process. Instead, however, the Court of\nAppeals reviewed the state courts’ decisions on the merits\nand concluded that they had unreasonably determined the\nfacts in light of the evidence. See 606 F.3d, at 1213–1216;\n384 Fed. Appx., at 545–546. Other Ninth Circuit cases\nhave done the same. See, e.g., Pearson v. Muntz, 606 F.3d\n606, 611 (2010). No opinion of ours supports converting\nCalifornia’s “some evidence” rule into a substantive fed\neral requirement. The liberty interest at issue here is the\ninterest in receiving parole when the California standards\nfor parole have been met, and the minimum procedures\nadequate for due-process protection of that interest are\nthose set forth in Greenholtz.* See Hayward v. Marshall,\n——————\n   * Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the\nrevocation of good-time credits should apply, citing In re Rosenkrantz,\n29 Cal. 4th 616, 657–658, 59 P.3d 174, 205 (2002), a California Su\npreme Court case that refers to our good-time-credits decision in\nSuperintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472\nU.S. 445 (1985). But Rosenkrantz did not purport to equate Califor\nnia’s parole system with good-time credits. It cites Hill twice. The first\ncitation merely observes that the court relied upon Hill in an earlier\nopinion adopting the “some evidence” test for decisions to revoke parole\nthat had previously been granted. 29 Cal. 4th, at 656, 59 P. 3d, at 204.\nThe second citation, which does occur in the part of the opinion discuss\ning the need for “some evidence” review in parole decisions, simply\nborrows language from Hill to support the proposition that “ ‘[r]equiring\n6                       SWARTHOUT v. COOKE\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\n603 F.3d 546, 559 (CA9 2010) (en banc). Greenholtz did\nnot inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite\nprocedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that\nthe evidence required; a fortiori it is no federal concern\nhere whether California’s “some evidence” rule of judicial\nreview (a procedure beyond what the Constitution de\nmands) was correctly applied.\n   It will not do to pronounce California’s “some evidence”\nrule to be “a component” of the liberty interest, 606 F.3d,\nat 1213. Such reasoning would subject to federal-court\nmerits review the application of all state-prescribed proce\ndures in cases involving liberty or property interests,\nincluding (of course) those in criminal prosecutions. That\nhas never been the law. To the contrary, we have long\nrecognized that “a ‘mere error of state law’ is not a denial\nof due process.” Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 121, n. 21\n(1982); see also Estelle, 502 U.S., at 67–68. Because the\nonly federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant\ninquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not\nwhether the state court decided the case correctly.\n   The Ninth Circuit’s questionable finding that there was\nno evidence in the record supporting the parole denials is\nirrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as\n§2254(a) requires. See id., at 67. The short of the matter\nis that the responsibility for assuring that the constitu\ntionally adequate procedures governing California’s parole\nsystem are properly applied rests with California courts,\nand is no part of the Ninth Circuit’s business.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents’\n——————\na modicum of evidence’ ” can “ ‘help to prevent arbitrary deprivations.’ ”\n29 Cal. 4th, at 658, 59 P. 3d, at 205 (quoting Hill, 472 U.S., at 455). In\nany event, the question of which due process requirements apply is one\nof federal law, not California law; and neither of these citations comes\nclose to addressing that question. Any doubt on that score is resolved\nby a subsequent footnote stating that the court’s decision is premised\nonly on state law. 29 Cal. 4th, at 658, n. 12, 59 P.3d, at 205, n. 12.\n              Cite as: 562 U.

J., and STEVENS, KENNEDY, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., joined. THOMAS, J., filed a dissenting opinion. ALITO, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\nSCALIA, delivered the opinion of the Court.\nWe decide whether a court or an arbitrator should consider the claim that a contract containing an arbitration provision is void for illegality.\n\nI\nRespondents John Cardegna and Donna Reuter entered into various deferred-payment transactions with petitioner Buckeye Check Cashing (Buckeye), in which they received cash in exchange for a personal check in the amount of the cash plus a finance charge. For each separate transaction they signed a \"Deferred Deposit and Disclosure Agreement\" (Agreement), which included the following arbitration provisions:\n\"1. Arbitration Disclosure By signing this Agreement, you agree that i[f] a dispute of any kind arises out of this Agreement or your application therefore or any instrument relating thereto, th[e]n either you or we or third-parties involved can choose to have that dispute resolved by binding arbitration as set forth in Paragraph 2 below . . . .\n2. Arbitration Provisions Any claim, dispute, or controversy. . . arising from or relating to this Agreement. . . or the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Arbitration Provision or the entire Agreement (collectively `Claim'), shall be resolved, upon the election of you or us or said third-parties, by binding arbitration . . . . This arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (`FAA'), 9 U.S. C. Sections 1-16. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law constraint [sic] with the FAA and applicable statu[t]es of limitations and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law . . . .\"\nRespondents brought this putative class action in Florida state court, alleging that Buckeye charged usurious interest rates and that the Agreement violated various Florida lending and consumer-protection laws, rendering it criminal on its face. Buckeye moved to compel arbitration. The trial court denied the motion, holding that a court rather than an arbitrator should resolve a claim that a contract is illegal and void ab initio. The District Court of Appeal of Florida for the Fourth District reversed, holding that because respondents did not challenge the arbitration provision itself, but instead claimed that the entire contract was void, the agreement to arbitrate was enforceable, and the question of the contract's legality should go to the arbitrator.\nRespondents appealed, and the Florida Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that to enforce an agreement to arbitrate in a contract challenged as unlawful \"`could breathe life into a contract that not only violates state law, but also is criminal in nature . . . .'\" 894 So. 2d 860, 862 (2005) (quoting Party Yards, Inc. v. Templeton, 751 So. 2d 121, 123 (Fla. App. 2000)). We granted certiorari. 545 U. S. ___ (2005).\n\nII\n\nA\nTo overcome judicial resistance to arbitration, Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S. C. §§116. Section 2 embodies the national policy favoring arbitration and places arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts:\n\"A written provision in . . . a contract . . . to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . . or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\"\nChallenges to the validity of arbitration agreements \"uponsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\" can be divided into two types. One type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate. See, e.g., Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 4-5 (1984) (challenging the agreement to arbitrate as void under California law insofar as it purported to cover claims brought under the state Franchise Investment Law). The other challenges the contract as a whole, either on a ground that directly affects the entire agreement (e.g., the agreement was fraudulently induced), or on the ground that the illegality of one of the contract's provisions renders the whole contract invalid.[1] Respondents' claim is of this second type. The crux of the complaint is that the contract as a whole (including its arbitration provision) is rendered invalid by the usurious finance charge.\nIn Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395 (1967), we addressed the question of whocourt or arbitratordecides these two types of challenges. The issue in the case was \"whether a claim of fraud in the inducement of the entire contract is to be resolved by the federal court, or whether the matter is to be referred to the arbitrators.\" Id., at 402. Guided by §4 of the FAA,[2] we held that \"if the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itselfan issue which goes to the making of the agreement to arbitratethe federal court may proceed to adjudicate it. But the statutory language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.\" Id., at 403-404 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). We rejected the view that the question of \"severability\" was one of state law, so that if state law held the arbitration provision not to be severable a challenge to the contract as a whole would be decided by the court. See id., at 400, 402-403.\nSubsequently, in Southland Corp., we held that the FAA \"create[d] a body of federal substantive law,\" which was \"applicable in state and federal court.\" 465 U.S., at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted). We rejected the view that state law could bar enforcement of §2, even in the context of state-law claims brought in state court. See id., at 10-14; see also Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 270-273 (1995).\n\nB\nPrima Paint and Southland answer the question presented here by establishing three propositions. First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract. Second, unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contract's validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance. Third, this arbitration law applies in state as well as federal courts. The parties have not requested, and we do not undertake, reconsideration of those holdings. Applying them to this case, we conclude that because respondents challenge the Agreement, but not specifically its arbitration provisions, those provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract. The challenge should therefore be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.\nIn declining to apply Prima Paint's rule of severability, the Florida Supreme Court relied on the distinction between void and voidable contracts. \"Florida public policy and contract law,\" it concluded, permit \"no severable, or salvageable, parts of a contract found illegal and void under Florida law.\" 894 So. 2d, at 864. Prima Paint makes this conclusion irrelevant. That case rejected application of state severability rules to the arbitration agreement without discussing whether the challenge at issue would have rendered the contract void or voidable. See 388 U.S., at 400-404. Indeed, the opinion expressly disclaimed any need to decide what state-law remedy was available, id., at 400, n. 3, (though Justice Black's dissent asserted that state law rendered the contract void, id., at 407). Likewise in Southland, which arose in state court, we did not ask whether the several challenges made therefraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the California Franchise Investment Lawwould render the contract void or voidable. We simply rejected the proposition that the enforceability of the arbitration agreement turned on the state legislature's judgment concerning the forum for enforcement of the state-law cause of action. See 465 U.S., at 10. So also here, we cannot accept the Florida Supreme Court's conclusion that enforceability of the arbitration agreement should turn on \"Florida public policy and contract law,\" 894 So. 2d, at 864.\n\nC\nRespondents assert that Prima Paint's rule of severability does not apply in state court. They argue that Prima Paint interpreted only §§3 and 4two of the FAA's procedural provisions, which appear to apply by their terms only in federal courtbut not §2, the only provision that we have applied in state court. This does not accurately describe Prima Paint. Although §4, in particular, had much to do with Prima Paint's understanding of the rule of severability, see 388 U.S., at 403-404, this rule ultimately arises out of §2, the FAA's substantive command that arbitration agreements be treated like all other contracts. The rule of severability establishes how this equalfooting guarantee for \"a written [arbitration] provision\" is to be implemented. Respondents' reading of Prima Paint as establishing nothing more than a federal-court rule of procedure also runs contrary to Southland's understanding of that case. One of the bases for Southland's application of §2 in state court was precisely Prima Paint's \"reli[ance] for [its] holding on Congress' broad power to fashion substantive rules under the Commerce Clause.\" 465 U.S., at 11; see also Prima Paint, supra, at 407 (Black, J., dissenting) (\"[t]he Court here holds that the [FAA], as a matter of federal substantive law . . .\" (emphasis added)). Southland itself refused to \"believe Congress intended to limit the Arbitration Act to disputes subject only to federal-court jurisdiction.\" 465 U.S., at 15.\nRespondents point to the language of §2, which renders \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable\" \"a written provision in\" or \"an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of\" a \"contract.\" Since, respondents argue, the only arbitration agreements to which §2 applies are those involving a \"contract,\" and since an agreement void ab initio under state law is not a \"contract,\" there is no \"written provision\" in or \"controversy arising out of\" a \"contract,\" to which §2 can apply. This argument echoes Justice Black's dissent in Prima Paint: \"Sections 2 and 3 of the Act assume the existence of a valid contract. They merely provide for enforcement where such a valid contract exists.\" 388 U.S., at 412-413. We do not read \"contract\" so narrowly. The word appears four times in §2. Its last appearance is in the final clause, which allows a challenge to an arbitration provision \"upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\" (Emphasis added.) There can be no doubt that \"contract\" as used this last time must include contracts that later prove to be void. Otherwise, the grounds for revocation would be limited to those that rendered a contract voidablewhich would mean (implausibly) that an arbitration agreement could be challenged as voidable but not as void. Because the sentence's final use of \"contract\" so obviously includes putative contracts, we will not read the same word earlier in the same sentence to have a more narrow meaning.[3] We note that neither Prima Paint nor Southland lends support to respondents' reading; as we have discussed, neither case turned on whether the challenge at issue would render the contract voidable or void.\n\n* * *\nIt is true, as respondents assert, that the Prima Paint rule permits a court to enforce an arbitration agreement in a contract that the arbitrator later finds to be void. But it is equally true that respondents' approach permits a court to deny effect to an arbitration provision in a contract that the court later finds to be perfectly enforceable. Prima Paint resolved this conundrumand resolved it in favor of the separate enforceability of arbitration provisions. We reaffirm today that, regardless of whether the challenge is brought in federal or state court, a challenge to the validity of the contract as a whole, and not specifically to the arbitration clause, must go to the arbitrator.\nThe judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nJUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\nI remain of the view that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S. C. §1 et seq., does not apply to proceedings in state courts. See Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 285-297 (1995) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681, 689 (1996) (same); Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444, 460 (2003) (same). Thus, in state-court proceedings, the FAA cannot be the basis for displacing a state law that prohibits enforcement of an arbitration clause contained in a contract that is unenforceable under state law. Accordingly, I would leave undisturbed the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.\nNOTES\n[1]  The issue of the contract's validity is different from the issue of whether any agreement between the alleged obligor and obligee was ever concluded. Our opinion today addresses only the former, and does not speak to the issue decided in the cases cited by respondents (and by the Florida Supreme Court), which hold that it is for courts to decide whether the alleged obligor ever signed the contract, Chastain v. Robinson-Humphrey Co., 957 F.2d 851 (CA11 1992), whether the signor lacked authority to commit the alleged principal, Sandvik AB v. Advent Int'l Corp., 220 F.3d 99 (CA3 2000); Sphere Drake Ins. Ltd. v. All American Ins. Co., 256 F.3d 587 (CA7 2001), and whether the signor lacked the mental capacity to assent, Spahr v. Secco, 330 F.3d 1266 (CA10 2003).\n[2]  In pertinent part, §4 reads:\n\n\"A party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any United States district court [with jurisdiction] . . . for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in a manner provided for in such agreement . . . . [U]pon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement . . . .\"\n[3]  Our more natural reading is confirmed by the use of the word \"contract\" elsewhere in the United States Code to refer to putative agreements, regardless of whether they are legal. For instance, the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, states that \"[e]very contract, combination. . . , or conspiracy in restraint of trade . . . is hereby declared to be illegal.\" 15 U.S. C. §1. Under respondents' reading of \"contract,\" a bewildering circularity would result: A contract illegal because it was in restraint of trade would not be a \"contract\" at all, and thus the statutory prohibition would not apply.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Egan, Counsel of Record, The Popham Law Firm, P.C., Kansas City, MO, for Respondent.\nJustice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\nIn this age discrimination case, the District Court excluded testimony by nonparties alleging discrimination at the hands of supervisors of the defendant company who played no role in the adverse employment decision challenged by the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals, having concluded that the District Court improperly applied a per se rule excluding the evidence, engaged in its own analysis of the relevant factors under Federal Rules of Evidence 401 and 403, and remanded with instructions to admit the challenged testimony. We granted certiorari on the question whether the Federal Rules of Evidence required admission of the testimony. We conclude that such evidence is neither per se admissible nor per se inadmissible. Because it is not entirely clear whether the District Court applied a per se rule, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for the District Court to conduct the relevant inquiry under the appropriate standard.\n\nI\nRespondent Ellen Mendelsohn was employed in the Business Development Strategy Group of petitioner Sprint/United Management Company (Sprint) from 1989 until 2002, when Sprint terminated her as a part of an ongoing company-wide reduction in force. She sued Sprint under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., alleging disparate treatment based on her age.\nIn support of her claim, Mendelsohn sought to introduce testimony by five other former Sprint employees who claimed that their supervisors had discriminated against them because of age. Three of the witnesses alleged that they heard one or more Sprint supervisors or managers make remarks denigrating older workers. One claimed that Sprint's intern program was a mechanism for age discrimination and that she had seen a spreadsheet suggesting that a supervisor considered age in making layoff decisions. Another witness was to testify that he had been given an unwarranted negative evaluation and \"banned\" from working at Sprint because of his age, and that he had witnessed another employee being harassed because of her age. App. 17a. The final witness alleged that Sprint had required him to get permission before hiring anyone over age 40, that after his termination he had been replaced by a younger employee, and that Sprint had rejected his subsequent employment applications.\nNone of the five witnesses worked in the Business Development Strategy Group with Mendelsohn, nor had any of them worked under the supervisors in her chain of command, which included James Fee, Mendelsohn's direct supervisor; Paul Reddick, Fee's direct manager and the decisionmaker in Mendelsohn's termination; and Bill Blessing, Reddick's supervisor and head of the Business Development Strategy Group. Neither did any of the proffered witnesses report hearing discriminatory remarks by Fee, Reddick, or Blessing.\n*1144 Sprint moved in limine to exclude the testimony, arguing that it was irrelevant to the central issue in the case: whether Reddick terminated Mendelsohn because of her age. See Fed. Rules Evid. 401, 402. Sprint claimed that the testimony would be relevant only if it came from employees who were \"similarly situated\" to Mendelsohn in that they had the same supervisors. App. 156a. Sprint also argued that, under Rule 403, the probative value of the evidence would be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, and undue delay.\nIn a minute order, the District Court granted the motion, excluding, in relevant part, evidence of \"discrimination against employees not similarly situated to plaintiff.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. In clarifying that Mendelsohn could only \"offer evidence of discrimination against Sprint employees who are similarly situated to her,\" the court defined \"`[s]imilarly situated employees,' for the purpose of this ruling, [as] requir[ing] proof that (1) Paul Ruddick [sic] was the decision-maker in any adverse employment action; and (2) temporal proximity.\" Ibid. Beyond that, the District Court provided no explanation of the basis for its ruling. As the trial proceeded, the judge orally clarified that the minute order was meant to exclude only testimony \"that Sprint treated other people unfairly on the basis of age,\" and would not bar testimony going to the \"totally different\" question \"whether the [reduction in force], which is [Sprint's] stated nondiscriminatory reason, is a pretext for age discrimination.\" App. 295a-296a.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit treated the minute order as the application of a per se rule that evidence from employees with other supervisors is irrelevant to proving discrimination in an ADEA case. Specifically, it concluded that the District Court abused its discretion by relying on Aramburu v. Boeing Co., 112 F.3d 1398 (C.A.10 1997). 466 F.3d 1223, 1227-1228 (C.A.10 2006). Aramburu held that \"[s]imilarly situated employees,\" for the purpose of showing disparate treatment in employee discipline, \"are those who deal with the same supervisor and are subject to the same standards governing performance evaluation and discipline.\" 112 F.3d, at 1404 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals viewed that case as inapposite because it addressed discriminatory discipline, not a company-wide policy of discrimination. The Court of Appeals then determined that the evidence was relevant and not unduly prejudicial, and reversed and remanded for a new trial. We granted certiorari, 551 U.S. ___, 127 S. Ct. 2937, 168 L. Ed. 2d 261 (2007), to determine whether, in an employment discrimination action, the Federal Rules of Evidence require admission of testimony by nonparties alleging discrimination at the hands of persons who played no role in the adverse employment decision challenged by the plaintiff.\n\nII\nThe parties focus their dispute on whether the Court of Appeals correctly held that the evidence was relevant and not unduly prejudicial under Rules 401 and 403. We conclude, however, that the Court of Appeals should not have engaged in that inquiry. Rather, as explained below, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the District Court applied a per se rule. Given the circumstances of this case and the unclear basis of the District Court's decision, the Court of Appeals should have remanded the case to the District Court for clarification.\n\nA\nIn deference to a district court's familiarity with the details of the case and *1145 its greater experience in evidentiary matters, courts of appeals afford broad discretion to a district court's evidentiary rulings. This Court has acknowledged:\n\"A district court is accorded a wide discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence under the Federal Rules. Assessing the probative value of [the proffered evidence], and weighing any factors counseling against admissibility is a matter first for the district court's sound judgment under Rules 401 and 403 ....\" United States v. Abel, 469 U.S. 45, 54, 105 S. Ct. 465, 83 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1984).\nThis is particularly true with respect to Rule 403 since it requires an \"on-the-spot balancing of probative value and prejudice, potentially to exclude as unduly prejudicial some evidence that already has been found to be factually relevant.\" 1 S. Childress & M. Davis, Federal Standards of Review § 4.02, p. 4-16 (3d ed.1999). Under this deferential standard, courts of appeals uphold Rule 403 rulings unless the district court has abused its discretion. See Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 183, n. 7, 117 S. Ct. 644, 136 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1997).\nHere, however, the Court of Appeals did not accord the District Court the deference we have described as the \"hallmark of abuse-of-discretion review.\" General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 143, 118 S. Ct. 512, 139 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1997). Instead, it reasoned that the District Court had \"erroneous[ly] conclu[ded] that Aramburu controlled the fate of the evidence in this case.\" 466 F.3d, at 1230, n. 4.\nTo be sure, Sprint in its motion in limine argued, with a citation to Aramburu's categorical bar, that \"[e]mployees may be similarly situated only if they had the same supervisor,\" App. 163a, and the District Court's minute order mirrors that blanket language.\nBut the District Court's discussion of the evidence neither cited Aramburu nor gave any other indication that its decision relied on that case. The minute order included only two sentences discussing the admissibility of the evidence:\n\"Plaintiff may offer evidence of discrimination against Sprint employees who are similarly situated to her. `Similarly situated employees,' for the purpose of this ruling, requires proof that (1) Paul Ruddick [sic] was the decision-maker in any adverse employment action; and (2) temporal proximity.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a.\nContrary to the Court of Appeals' conclusion, these sentences include no analysis suggesting that the District Court applied a per se rule excluding this type of evidence.\nMendelsohn argued on appeal[1] that the District Court must have viewed Aramburu as controlling because Sprint cited the case in support of its in limine motion. But neither party's submissions to the District Court suggested that Aramburu was controlling. Sprint's memorandum in support of its motion mentioned the case only in a string citation, and not for the proposition that only \"similarly situated\" witnesses' testimony would be admissible.[2]*1146 App. 163a. Mendelsohn did not cite the case in her memorandum in opposition, see id., at 208a, and Sprint did not address it in its reply brief, see id., at 221a.\nMendelsohn further argued that the District Court's use of the phrase \"similarly situated,\" also used in Aramburu, evidenced its reliance on that case. Although the District Court used the same phrase, we decline to read the District Court's decision as relying on a case that was not controlling. Aramburu defined the phrase \"similarly situated\" in the entirely different context of a plaintiff's allegation that nonminority employees were treated more favorably than minority employees. 112 F.3d, at 1403-1406. Absent reason to do so, we should not assume the District Court adopted that \"similarly situated\" analysis when it addressed a very different kind of evidence. An appellate court should not presume that a district court intended an incorrect legal result when the order is equally susceptible of a correct reading, particularly when the applicable standard of review is deferential.\nMendelsohn additionally argued that the District Court must have meant to apply such a rule because that was the nature of the argument in Sprint's in limine motion. But the in limine motion did not suggest that the evidence is never admissible; it simply argued that such evidence lacked sufficient probative value \"in this case\" to be relevant or outweigh prejudice and delay. App. 156a.\nWhen a district court's language is ambiguous, as it was here, it is improper for the court of appeals to presume that the lower court reached an incorrect legal conclusion. A remand directing the district court to clarify its order is generally permissible and would have been the better approach in this case.\n\nB\nIn the Court of Appeals' view, the District Court excluded the evidence as per se irrelevant, and so had no occasion to reach the question whether such evidence, if relevant, should be excluded under Rule 403. The Court of Appeals, upon concluding that such evidence was not per se irrelevant, decided that it was relevant in the circumstances of this case and undertook its own balancing under Rule 403. But questions of relevance and prejudice are for the District Court to determine in the first instance. Abel, supra, at 54, 105 S. Ct. 465 (\"Assessing the probative value of [evidence], and weighing any factors counseling against admissibility is a matter first for the district court's sound judgment under Rules 401 and 403 ...\"). Rather than assess the relevance of the evidence itself and conduct its own balancing of its probative value and potential prejudicial effect, the Court of Appeals should have allowed the District Court to make these determinations in the first instance, explicitly and on the record.[3] See Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 291, 102 S. Ct. 1781, 72 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1982) (When a district court \"fail[s] to make a finding because of an erroneous view of the law, the usual rule is that there should be a remand for further proceedings to permit the trial court to make the missing findings\"). With respect to evidentiary questions in general and Rule 403 in particular, a district court virtually always is in the better position to assess the admissibility of the evidence in the context of the particular case before it.\n*1147 We note that, had the District Court applied a per se rule excluding the evidence, the Court of Appeals would have been correct to conclude that it had abused its discretion. Relevance and prejudice under Rules 401 and 403 are determined in the context of the facts and arguments in a particular case, and thus are generally not amenable to broad per se rules. See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 401, 28 U.S.C.App., p. 864 (\"Relevancy is not an inherent characteristic of any item of evidence but exists only as a relation between an item of evidence and a matter properly provable in the case\"). But, as we have discussed, there is no basis in the record for concluding that the District Court applied a blanket rule.\n\nIII\nThe question whether evidence of discrimination by other supervisors is relevant in an individual ADEA case is fact based and depends on many factors, including how closely related the evidence is to the plaintiff's circumstances and theory of the case. Applying Rule 403 to determine if evidence is prejudicial also requires a fact-intensive, context-specific inquiry. Because Rules 401 and 403 do not make such evidence per se admissible or per se inadmissible, and because the inquiry required by those Rules is within the province of the District Court in the first instance, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with instructions to have the District Court clarify the basis for its evidentiary ruling under the applicable Rules.\nIt is so ordered.\nNOTES\n[1]  Although, as noted above, the parties do not address in their filings before this Court the grounds on which we base our decision, we shall consider the relevant arguments they made before the Court of Appeals.\n[2]  Even if Sprint had argued that Aramburu requires a per se rule excluding such evidence, it would be inappropriate for the reviewing court to assume, absent indication in the District Court's opinion, that the lower court adopted a party's incorrect argument. Cf. Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U.S. 163, 183, 116 S. Ct. 604, 133 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"[W]e should not assume that a court of appeals has adopted a legal position only because [a party] supported it\").\n[3]  The only exception to this rule is when \"the record permits only one resolution of the factual issue.\" Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 292, 102 S. Ct. 1781, 72 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1982).

Petitioners moved to compel arbitration. The District Court refused to compel arbitration of the RICO claims on the ground that the arbitration clauses in the parties' agreements prohibited awards of \"punitive damages,\" and hence an arbitrator lacked authority to award treble damages under RICO. Accordingly, the court deemed the arbitration agreements unenforceable with respect to those claims. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: It is unclear whether the agreements actually prevent an arbitrator from awarding treble damages under RICO. This Court's cases have placed different statutory treble damages provisions on different points along the spectrum between purely compensatory and strictly punitive awards. In particular, the Court has repeatedly acknowledged that RICO's treble-damages provision is remedial in nature, and it is not clear that the parties intended the term \"punitive\" to encompass claims for treble damages under RICO. Since the Court does not know how the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations, the questions whether they render the parties' agreement unenforceable and whether it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceability in the first instance are unusually abstract. It would be premature for the Court to address them; the proper course is to compel arbitration. Pp. 403-407.\n285 F. 3d 971, reversed and remanded.\nSCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except THOMAS, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT.\nWilliam E. Grauer argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Christopher R. J. Pace, James W. Quinn, Jeffrey S. Klein, Edward Soto, and Gregory S. Coleman. Joe R. Whatley, Jr., argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Charlene P. Ford and James B. Tilghman, Jr.*\nJUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn this case, we are asked to decide whether respondents can be compelled to arbitrate claims arising under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. § 1961 et seq., notwithstanding the fact that the parties' arbitration agreements may be construed to limit the arbitrator's authority to award damages under that statute.\n\n\n2\n* Respondents are members of a group of physicians who filed suit against managed-health-care organizations including petitioners PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc., and PacifiCare Operations, Inc. (collectively, PacifiCare), and United-Healthcare, Inc., and United Health Group Inc. (collectively, United). These physicians alleged that the defendants unlawfully failed to reimburse them for health-care services that they had provided to patients covered by defendants' health plans. They brought causes of action under RICO, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and federal and state prompt-pay statutes, as well as claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and in quantum meruit. In re: Managed Care Litigation, 132 F. Supp. 2d 989, 992 (SD Fla. 2000).\n\n\n3\nOf particular concern here, PacifiCare and United moved the District Court to compel arbitration, arguing that provisions in their contracts with respondents required arbitration of these disputes, including those arising under RICO. Ibid. Respondents opposed the motion on the ground that, because the arbitration provisions prohibit an award of punitive damages, see App. 107, 147, 168, 212, respondents could not obtain \"meaningful relief\" in arbitration for their claims under the RICO statute, which authorizes treble damages, 18 U. S. C. § 1964(c). See Paladino v. Avnet Computer Technologies, Inc., 134 F. 3d 1054, 1062 (CA11 1998) (holding that where a remedial limitation in an arbitration agreement prevents a plaintiff from obtaining \"meaningful relief\" for a statutory claim, the agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable with respect to that claim).\n\n\n4\nThe District Court denied petitioners' request to compel arbitration of the RICO claims. 132 F. Supp. 2d, at 1007. The court concluded that given the remedial limitations in the relevant contracts, it was, indeed, \"faced with a potential Paladino situation ..., where the plaintiff may not be able to obtain meaningful relief for allegations of statutory violations in an arbitration forum.\" Id., at 1005. Accordingly, it found the arbitration agreements unenforceable with respect to respondents' RICO claims. Id., at 1007. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed \"for the reasons set forth in [the District Court's] comprehensive opinion,\" In re: Humana Inc. Managed Care Litigation, 285 F. 3d 971, 973 (2002), and we granted certiorari, 537 U. S. 946 (2002).\n\nII\n\n5\nPetitioners argue that whether the remedial limitations render their arbitration agreements unenforceable is not a question of \"arbitrability,\" and hence should have been decided by an arbitrator, rather than a court, in the first instance. They also claim that even if this question is one of arbitrability, and is therefore properly within the purview of the courts at this time, the remedial limitations at issue do not require invalidation of their arbitration agreements. Either way, petitioners contend, the lower courts should have compelled arbitration. We conclude that it would be premature for us to address these questions at this time.\n\n\n6\nOur decision in Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528 (1995), supplies the analytic framework for assessing the ripeness of this dispute. In Vimar, we dealt with a bill of lading concerning a shipment of goods from Morocco to Massachusetts. Upon receipt of the goods, the purchaser discovered that they had been damaged, and, along with its insurer (Vimar), filed suit against the shipper. The shipper sought to compel arbitration, relying on choice-of-law and arbitration clauses in the bill of lading under which disputes arising out of the parties' agreement were to be governed by Japanese law and resolved through arbitration before the Tokyo Maritime Arbitration Commission. Vimar countered by arguing that the arbitration clause violated the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), 46 U. S. C. App. § 1300 et seq., and hence was unenforceable. 515 U. S., at 531-532. In particular, Vimar claimed that \"there is no guarantee foreign arbitrators will apply COGSA\"; that the foreign arbitrator was likely to apply rules of Japanese law under which respondents' liability might be less than what it would be under COGSA; and that this would violate \"[t]he central guarantee of [COGSA] § 3(8) ... that the terms of a bill of lading may not relieve the carrier of obligations or diminish the legal duties specified by the Act.\" Id., at 539.\n\n\n7\nNotwithstanding Vimar's insistence that the arbitration agreement violated federal policy as embodied in COGSA, we declined to reach the issue and held that the arbitration clause was, at least initially, enforceable. \"At this interlocutory stage,\" we explained, \"it is not established what law the arbitrators will apply to petitioner's claims or that petitioner will receive diminished protection as a result. The arbitrators may conclude that COGSA applies of its own force or that Japanese law does not apply so that, under another clause of the bill of lading, COGSA controls.\" Id., at 540. We further emphasized that \"mere speculation that the foreign arbitrators might apply Japanese law which, depending on the proper construction of COGSA, might reduce respondents' legal obligations, does not in and of itself lessen liability under COGSA § 3(8),\" nor did it provide an adequate basis upon which to declare the relevant arbitration agreement unenforceable. Id., at 541 (emphases added). We found that \"[w]hatever the merits of petitioner's comparative reading of COGSA and its Japanese counterpart, its claim is premature.\" Id., at 540.\n\n\n8\nThe case at bar arrives in a similar posture. Two of the four arbitration agreements at issue provide that \"punitive damages shall not be awarded [in arbitration],\" App. 107, 147; one provides that \"[t]he arbitrators ... shall have no authority to award any punitive or exemplary damages,\" id., at 212; and one provides that \"[t]he arbitrators ... shall have no authority to award extra contractual damages of any kind, including punitive or exemplary damages ...,\" id., at 168. Respondents insist, and the District Court agreed, 132 F. Supp. 2d, at 1000-1001, 1005, that these provisions preclude an arbitrator from awarding treble damages under RICO. We think that neither our precedents nor the ambiguous terms of the contracts make this clear.\n\n\n9\nOur cases have placed different statutory treble-damages provisions on different points along the spectrum between purely compensatory and strictly punitive awards. Thus, in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 784 (2000), we characterized the treble-damages provision of the False Claims Act, 31 U. S. C. §§ 3729-3733, as \"essentially punitive in nature.\" In Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U. S. 477, 485 (1977), on the other hand, we explained that the treble-damages provision of § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 15, \"is in essence a remedial provision.\" Likewise in American Soc. of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U. S. 556, 575 (1982), we noted that \"the antitrust private action [which allows for treble damages] was created primarily as a remedy for the victims of antitrust violations.\" (Emphasis added.) And earlier this Term, in Cook County v. United States ex rel. Chandler, ante, at 130, we stated that \"it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, serving remedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives.\" Indeed, we have repeatedly acknowledged that the treble-damages provision contained in RICO itself is remedial in nature. In Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 151 (1987), we stated that \"[b]oth RICO and the Clayton Act are designed to remedy economic injury by providing for the recovery of treble damages, costs, and attorney's fees.\" (Emphasis added.) And in Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 241 (1987) we took note of the \"remedial function\" of RICO's treble-damages provision.\n\n\n10\nIn light of our case law's treatment of statutory treble damages, and given the uncertainty surrounding the parties' intent with respect to the contractual term \"punitive,\"1 the application of the disputed language to respondents' RICO claims is, to say the least, in doubt. And Vimar instructs that we should not, on the basis of \"mere speculation\" that an arbitrator might interpret these ambiguous agreements in a manner that casts their enforceability into doubt, take upon ourselves the authority to decide the antecedent question of how the ambiguity is to be resolved.2 515 U. S., at 541. In short, since we do not know how the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations, the questions whether they render the parties' agreements unenforceable and whether it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceability in the first instance are unusually abstract. As in Vimar, the proper course is to compel arbitration. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n11\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n12\nJUSTICE THOMAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Briefs ofamici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Chamber of Commerce of the United States by Evan M. Tager, Miriam R. Nemetz, and Robin S. Conrad; for the National Association of Manufacturers et al. by Miguel A. Estrada, Andrew S. Tulumello, Jan S.

Samp.\nBriefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the National Association of Consumer Advocates by Craig Jordan; for Public Citizen, Inc., by Scott L.

Paul Bland, Jr.\n\n\n1\n Contrary to respondents' contention, the prohibition in Dr. Manual Porth's contract against an arbitrator's awarding \"extracontractual\" damages is likewise ambiguous. This language might mean, as respondents would have it, that an arbitrator is prohibited from awarding any damages other than for breach of contract. Brief for Respondents 20-21. But it might only mean that an arbitrator cannot award noneconomic damages such as punitive or mental-anguish damages. See 3 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies: Damages-Equity-Restitution § 12.1(1), p. 8 (2d ed. 1993) (\"Punitive damages and mental anguish damages are thus considered `extra-contractual,' and usually denied in pure contract cases\")\n\n\n2\n If the contractual ambiguity could itself be characterized as raising a \"gateway\" question of arbitrability, then it would be appropriate for a court to answer it in the first instance. But we noted just this Term that \"the phrase `question of arbitrability' has a ... limited scope.\"Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002). Indeed, we have \"found the phrase [question of arbitrability] applicable in the kind of narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter, where they are not likely to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would do so, and, consequently, where reference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.\" Id., at 83-84. Given our presumption in favor of arbitration, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1983), we think the preliminary question whether the remedial limitations at issue here prohibit an award of RICO treble damages is not a question of arbitrability.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

ANTHONY CARDELL \n\n                   HAYNES \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 09–273.   Decided February 22, 2010 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  This case presents the question whether any decision of\nthis Court “clearly establishes” that a judge, in ruling on\nan objection to a peremptory challenge under Batson v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), must reject a demeanor\nbased explanation for the challenge unless the judge per\nsonally observed and recalls the aspect of the prospective\njuror’s demeanor on which the explanation is based. The\nCourt of Appeals appears to have concluded that either\nBatson itself or Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U.S. 472 (2008),\nclearly established such a rule, but the Court of Appeals\nread far too much into those decisions, and its holding, if\nallowed to stand, would have important implications. We\ntherefore grant the petition for certiorari, grant respon\ndent’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                              I\n   Respondent was tried in a Texas state court for the\nmurder of a police officer, and the State sought the death\npenalty. During voir dire, two judges presided at different\nstages. Judge Harper presided when the attorneys ques\ntioned the prospective jurors individually, but Judge\nWallace took over when peremptory challenges were exer\ncised. When the prosecutor struck an African-American\njuror named Owens, respondent’s attorney raised a Batson\n2                   THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nobjection. Judge Wallace determined that respondent had\nmade out a prima facie case under Batson, and the prose\ncutor then offered a race-neutral explanation that was\nbased on Owens’ demeanor during individual questioning.\nSpecifically, the prosecutor asserted that Owens’ de\nmeanor had been “somewhat humorous” and not “serious”\nand that her “body language” had belied her “true feeling.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 187. Based on his observations of\nOwens during questioning by respondent’s attorney, the\nprosecutor stated, he believed that she “had a predisposi\ntion” and would not look at the possibility of imposing a\ndeath sentence “in a neutral fashion.” Id., at 188. Re\nspondent’s attorney did not dispute the prosecutor’s char\nacterization of Owens’ demeanor, but he asserted that her\nanswers on the jury questionnaire “show[ed] that she was\na juror who [was] leaning towards the State’s case.” Ibid.\nAfter considering the prosecutor’s explanation and the\narguments of defense counsel, Judge Wallace stated that\nthe prosecutor’s reason for the strike was “race-neutral”\nand denied the Batson objection without further explana\ntion. Id., at 189.\n   The case proceeded to trial, respondent was convicted\nand sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals affirmed the conviction. Rejecting respondent’s\nargument that “a trial judge who did not witness the\nactual voir dire cannot, as a matter of law, fairly evaluate\na Batson challenge,” id., at 173, the Court of Criminal\nAppeals wrote:\n    “There are many factors which a trial judge—even one\n    who did not preside over the voir dire examinations—\n    can consider in determining whether the opponent of\n    the peremptory strikes has met his burden. These in\n    clude the nature and strength of the parties’ argu\n    ments during the Batson hearing and the attorneys’\n    demeanor and credibility.

This\nCourt denied respondent’s petition for a writ of certiorari.\nHaynes v. Texas, 535 U.S. 999 (2002).\n   After the Texas courts denied his application for state\nhabeas relief, respondent filed a federal habeas petition.\nThe District Court denied the petition and observed that\nthis Court had never held that the deference to state-court\nfactual determinations that is mandated by the federal\nhabeas statute is inapplicable when the judge ruling on a\nBatson objection did not observe the jury selection. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 80, n. 10.\n   A panel of the Court of Appeals granted a certificate of\nappealability with respect to respondent’s Batson objec\ntions concerning Owens and one other prospective juror.\nHaynes v. Quarterman, 526 F.3d 189, 202 (CA5 2008). In\nits opinion granting the certificate, the panel discussed\nour opinion in Snyder at length and then concluded:\n     “Under Snyder’s application of Batson, . . . an appel\n     late court applying Batson arguably should find clear\n     error when the record reflects that the trial court was\n     not able to verify the aspect of the juror’s demeanor\n     upon which the prosecutor based his or her peremp\n     tory challenge.” 526 F.3d, at 199.\n  When the same panel later ruled on the merits of re\nspondent’s Batson claim regarding juror Owens,1 the court\n——————\n  1 Because the panel held that the strike of Owens violated Batson, the\n\npanel did not rule on the legitimacy of the other strike as to which a\n4                      THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                            Per Curiam\n\nadopted the rule that it had previously termed “ar\nguabl[e].” See 526 F.3d, at 199; Haynes v. Quarterman,\n561 F.3d 535, 541 (CA5 2009). The court concluded that\nthe decisions of the state courts were not owed “AEDPA\ndeference” in this case “because the state courts engaged\nin pure appellate fact-finding for an issue that turns en\ntirely on demeanor.” Ibid. The court then held that\n    “no court, including ours, can now engage in a proper\n    adjudication of the defendant’s demeanor-based Bat\n    son challenge as to prospective juror Owens because\n    we will be relying solely on a paper record and would\n    thereby contravene Batson and its clearly-established\n    ‘factual inquiry’ requirement. See, e.g., Snyder, [552\n    U. S., at 477]; Batson, [476 U. S., at 95].” Ibid. (foot\n    note omitted).\n                              II\n   Respondent cannot obtain federal habeas relief under 28\nU.S. C. §2254(d)(1) unless he can show that the decision\nof the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals “was contrary to,\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.”\nA legal principle is “clearly established” within the mean\ning of this provision only when it is embodied in a holding\nof this Court. See Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70, 74\n(2006); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000).\nUnder §2254(d)(1), a habeas petitioner may obtain relief\n(1) “if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to\nthat reached by this Court on a question of law or if the\nstate court decides a case differently than this Court has\non a set of materially indistinguishable facts”; or (2) “if the\nstate court identifies the correct governing legal principle\nfrom this Court’s decisions but unreasonably applies that\n—————— \n\ncertificate of appealability had been issued.

Metropolitan Housing Devel\nopment Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977)). This general\nrequirement, however, did not clearly establish the rule on\nwhich the Court of Appeals’ decision rests. Batson noted\nthe need for a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory\nchallenge to “tak[e] into account all possible explanatory\nfactors in the particular case,” 476 U.S., at 95 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). See also Miller-El v. Dretke,\n545 U.S. 231, 239 (2005); Johnson v. California, 545 U.S.\n162, 170 (2005). Thus, where the explanation for a per\nemptory challenge is based on a prospective juror’s de\nmeanor, the judge should take into account, among other\nthings, any observations of the juror that the judge was\nable to make during the voir dire. But Batson plainly did\nnot go further and hold that a demeanor-based explana\ntion must be rejected if the judge did not observe or cannot\nrecall the juror’s demeanor.\n   Nor did we establish such a rule in Snyder.2 In that\n——————\n 2 Even   if Snyder did alter or add to Batson’s rule (as the Court of\n6                        THALER v. HAYNES\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\ncase, the judge who presided over the voir dire also ruled\non the Batson objections, and thus we had no occasion to\nconsider how Batson applies when different judges preside\nover these two stages of the jury selection process. Sny\nder, 552 U.S., at 475–478. The part of Snyder on which\nthe Court of Appeals relied concerned a very different\nproblem. The prosecutor in that case asserted that he had\nexercised a peremptory challenge for two reasons, one of\nwhich was based on demeanor (i.e., that the juror had\nappeared to be nervous), and the trial judge overruled the\nBatson objection without explanation. 552 U.S., at 478–\n479. We concluded that the record refuted the explanation\nthat was not based on demeanor and, in light of the par\nticular circumstances of the case, we held that the per\nemptory challenge could not be sustained on the de\nmeanor-based ground, which might not have figured in the\ntrial judge’s unexplained ruling. Id., at 479–486. Nothing\nin this analysis supports the blanket rule on which the\ndecision below appears to rest.\n   The opinion in Snyder did note that when the explana\ntion for a peremptory challenge “invoke[s] a juror’s de\nmeanor,” the trial judge’s “first hand observations” are of\ngreat importance. Id., at 477. And in explaining why we\ncould not assume that the trial judge had credited the\nclaim that the juror was nervous, we noted that, because\nthe peremptory challenge was not exercised until some\ntime after the juror was questioned, the trial judge might\nnot have recalled the juror’s demeanor. Id., at 479. These\nobservations do not suggest that, in the absence of a per\n——————\nAppeals seems to have concluded), Snyder could not have constituted\n“clearly established Federal law as determined by” this Court for\npurposes of respondent’s habeas petition because we decided Snyder\nnearly six years after his conviction became final and more than six\nyears after the relevant state-court decision. See Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U.S. 362, 390 (2000) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.); id., at\n412 (opinion for the Court by O’Connor, J.).\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nsonal recollection of the juror’s demeanor, the judge could\nnot have accepted the prosecutor’s explanation. Indeed,\nSnyder quoted the observation in Hernandez v. New York,\n500 U.S. 352, 365 (1991) (plurality opinion), that the best\nevidence of the intent of the attorney exercising a strike is\noften that attorney’s demeanor. See 552 U.S., at 477.\n   Accordingly, we hold that no decision of this Court\nclearly establishes the categorical rule on which the Court\nof Appeals appears to have relied, and we therefore re\nverse the judgment and remand the case for proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Our decision does not man\ndate the rejection of respondent’s Batson claim regarding\njuror Owens. On remand, the Court of Appeals may con\nsider whether the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals’ de\ntermination may be overcome under the federal habeas\nstatute’s standard for reviewing a state court’s resolution\nof questions of fact.\n                                             It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

The Federal District Court permitted the proceedings to go forward in his absence, and he was convicted and subsequently arrested and sentenced.  In affirming his convictions, the Court of Appeals rejected his argument that his trial was prohibited by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43, which provides that a defendant must be present at every stage of trial \"except as otherwise provided\" by the Rule and which lists situations in which a right to be present may be waived, including when a defendant, initially present, \"is voluntarily absent after the trial has commenced.\"\nHeld:  Rule 43 prohibits the trial in absentia of a defendant who is not present at the beginning of trial.  The Rule's express use of the limiting phrase \"except as otherwise provided\" clearly indicates that the list of situations in which the trial may proceed without the defendant is exclusive.  Moreover, the Rule is a restatement of the law that existed at the time it was adopted in 1944.  Its distinction between flight before and during trial also is rational, as it marks a point at which the costs of delaying a trial are likely to increase;  helps to assure that any waiver is knowing and voluntary;  and deprives the defendant of the option of terminating the trial if it seems that the verdict will go against him.  Because Rule 43 is dispositive, Crosby's claim that the Constitution also prohibited his trial in absentia is not reached.  Pp. ____.\n951 F.2d 357, reversed and remanded.\nBLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nMark D. Nyvold, St. Paul, Minn., appointed by this Court, for petitioner.\nRichard H. Seamon, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nJustice BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case requires us to decide whether Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 permits the trial in absentia of a defendant who absconds prior to trial and is absent at its beginning.  We hold that it does not.\n\n\n2\n* In April 1988, a federal grand jury in the District of Minnesota indicted petitioner Michael Crosby and others on a number of counts of mail fraud.  The indictment alleged that Crosby and his codefendants had devised a fraudulent scheme to sell military-veteran commemorative medallions supposedly to fund construction of a theme park honoring veterans.  Crosby appeared before a federal magistrate on June 15, 1988, and, upon his plea of not guilty, was conditionally released from detention after agreeing to post a $100,000 bond and remain in the State. Subsequently, he attended pretrial conferences and hearings with his attorney and was advised that the trial was scheduled to begin on October 12.\n\n\n3\nCrosby did not appear on October 12, however, nor could he be found.  United States deputy marshals reported that his house looked as though it had been \"cleaned out,\" and a neighbor reported that petitioner's car had been backed halfway into his garage the previous evening, as if he were packing its trunk.  As the day wore on, the court remarked several times that the pool of 54 potential jurors was being kept waiting, and that the delay in the proceedings would interfere with the court's calendar.  The prosecutor noted that Crosby's attorney and his three codefendants were present, and commented on the difficulty she would have in rescheduling the case, should Crosby later appear, because some of her many witnesses were elderly and had health problems.\n\n\n4\nWhen the District Court raised the subject of conducting the trial in Crosby's absence, Crosby's attorney objected. Nevertheless, after several days of delay and a fruitless search for Crosby, the court, upon a formal request from the Government, decided that trial would commence on October 17.  The court ordered Crosby's $100,000 bond forfeited and stated for the record its findings that Crosby had been given adequate notice of the trial date, that his absence was knowing and deliberate, and that requiring the Government to try Crosby separately from his codefendants would present extreme difficulty for the Government, witnesses, counsel, and the court.  It further concluded that Crosby voluntarily had waived his constitutional right to be present during the trial, and that the public interest in proceeding with the trial in his absence outweighed his interest in being present during the proceedings.  Trial began on October 17, with petitioner's counsel actively participating, and continued in Crosby's absence until November 18, when the jury returned verdicts of guilty on charges against Crosby and two of his codefendants.  See United States v. Cheatham, 899 F.2d 747 (CA8 1990).  One codefendant was acquitted.\n\n\n5\nApproximately six months later, Crosby was arrested in Florida and brought back to Minnesota, where he was sentenced to 20 years in prison followed by 5 years on probation with specified conditions.  Crosby's convictions were upheld by the Court of Appeals, which rejected his argument that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 forbids the trial in absentia of a defendant who is not present at the beginning of trial.  917 F.2d 362, 364-366 (CA8 1990).  Noting that the other Courts of Appeals that considered the question had found trial in absentia permissible,** the court concluded that the District Court had acted within its discretion in electing to proceed.  Id., at 365-366.  We granted certiorari.  --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1261, 117 L.Ed.2d 490 (1992).\n\nII\nRule 43 provides in relevant part:\n\n6\n\"(a) Presence Required.  The defendant shall be present at      the arraignment, at the time of the plea, at every stage of      the trial including the impaneling of the jury and the return      of the verdict, and at the imposition of sentence, except as      otherwise provided by this rule.\n\n\n7\n\"(b) Continued Presence Not Required.  The further progress      of the trial to and including the return of the verdict shall      not be prevented and the defendant shall be considered to      have waived the right to be present whenever a defendant,      initially present,\n\n\n8\n\"(1) is voluntarily absent after the trial has      commenced. . . .\"\n\n\n9\nThe Government concedes that the Rule does not specifically authorize the trial in absentia of a defendant who was not present at the beginning of his trial.  The Government argues, nonetheless, that \"Rule 43 does not purport to contain a comprehensive listing of the circumstances under which the right to be present may be waived.\"  Brief for United States 16. Accordingly, the Government contends, Crosby's position rests not on the express provisions of Rule 43, but solely on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius.  Ibid.  We disagree.  It is not necessary to invoke that maxim in order to conclude that Rule 43 does not allow full trials in absentia.  The Rule declares explicitly:  \"The defendant shall be present . . . at every stage of the trial . . . except as otherwise provided by this rule\" (emphasis added).  The list of situations in which the trial may proceed without the defendant is marked as exclusive not by the \"expression of one\" circumstance, but rather by the express use of a limiting phrase.  In that respect the language and structure of the Rule could not be more clear.\n\n\n10\nThe Government, however, urges us to look for guidance at the existing law, which the Rule was meant to restate, at the time of its adoption in 1944.  See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 43, 18 U.S.C.App., p. 821.  That inquiry does not assist the Government.  \"It is well settled that . . . at common law the personal presence of the defendant is essential to a valid trial and conviction on a charge of felony. . . .  If he is absent, . . . a conviction will be set aside.\"  W. Mikell, Clark's Criminal Procedure 492 (2d ed. 1918);  accord, Goldin, Presence of the Defendant at Rendition of the Verdict in Felony Cases, 16 Colum.L.Rev. 18, 20 (1916);  F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice 388 (9th ed. 1889);  1 J. Bishop, New Criminal Procedure 178-179 (4th ed. 1895), and cases cited there. The right generally was considered unwaivable in felony cases. Mikell, at 492;  Bishop, at 175 and 178.  This canon was premised on the notion that a fair trial could take place only if the jurors met the defendant face-to-face and only if those testifying against the defendant did so in his presence.  See Wharton, at 392;  Bishop, at 178.  It was thought \"contrary to the dictates of humanity to let a prisoner 'waive that advantage which a view of his sad plight might give him by inclining the hearts of the jurors to listen to his defence with indulgence.' \"  Ibid., quoting Prine v. Commonwealth, 18 Pa. 103, 104 (1851).\n\n\n11\nIn Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442, 32 S.Ct. 250, 56 L.Ed. 500 (1912), a case that concerned a defendant who had absented himself voluntarily on two occasions from his ongoing trial in the Philippines, this Court authorized a limited exception to the general rule, an exception that was codified eventually in Rule 43(b).  Because it did \" 'not seem to us to be consonant with the dictates of common sense that an accused person, being at large upon bail, should be at liberty, whenever he pleased, to withdraw himself from the courts of his country and to break up a trial already commenced,' \" 223 U.S., at 457, 32 S.Ct., at 254, quoting Falk v. United States, 15 App.D.C. 446, 454 (1899), cert. denied, 181 U.S. 618, 636, 21 S.Ct. 923, 45 L.Ed. 1030 (1901), the Court held:\n\n\n12\n\"[W]here the offense is not capital and the accused is not in      custody, . . . if, after the trial has begun in his presence,      he voluntarily absents himself, this does not nullify what      has been done or prevent the completion of the trial, but, on      the contrary, operates as a waiver of his right to be present      and leaves the court free to proceed with the trial in like      manner and with like effect as if he were present.\"  223      U.S., at 455, 32 S.Ct., at 254 (emphasis added).\n\n\n13\nDiaz was cited by the Advisory Committee that drafted Rule 43.  The Committee explained:  \"The second sentence of the rule is a restatement of existing law that, except in capital cases, the defendant may not defeat the proceedings by voluntarily absenting himself after the trial has been commenced in his presence.\" Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 43, 18 U.S.C.App., p. 821.  There is no reason to believe that the drafters intended the Rule to go further.  Commenting on a preliminary version of the rule, Judge John B. Sanborn, a member of the Committee, stated:\n\n\n14\n\"I think it would be inadvisable to conduct criminal trials      in the absence of the defendant.  That has never been the      practice, and, whether the defendant wants to attend the      trial or not, I think he should be compelled to be present.      If, during the trial, he disappears, there is, of course, no      reason why the trial should not proceed without him.\"  2 M.      Wilken and N. Triffin, Drafting History of the Federal Rules      of Criminal Procedure 236 (1991).\n\n\n15\nThe Court of Appeals in the present case recognized that this Court in Diaz had not addressed the situation of the defendant who fails to appear for the commencement of trial.  Nevertheless, the court concluded:  \"It would be anomalous to attach more significance to a defendant's absence at commencement than to absence during more important substantive portions of the trial.\" 917 F.2d, at 365.  While it may be true that there are no \"talismanic properties which differentiate the commencement of a trial from later stages,\" Government of the Virgin Islands v. Brown, 507 F.2d 186, 189 (CA3 1975), we do not find the distinction between pre- and midtrial flight so farfetched as to convince us that Rule 43 cannot mean what it says.  As a general matter, the costs of suspending a proceeding already under way will be greater than the cost of postponing a trial not yet begun. If a clear line is to be drawn marking the point at which the costs of delay are likely to outweigh the interests of the defendant and society in having the defendant present, the commencement of trial is at least a plausible place at which to draw that line.  See Hopt v. Utah, 110 U.S. 574, 579, 4 S.Ct. 202, 204, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884) (discussing the public's interest in strict enforcement of statutory requirement that defendant be present at trial).\n\n\n16\nThere are additional practical reasons for distinguishing between flight before and flight during a trial.  As did Diaz, the Rule treats midtrial flight as a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to be present.  Whether or not the right constitutionally may be waived in other circumstances—and we express no opinion here on that subject—the defendant's initial presence serves to assure that any waiver is indeed knowing. \"Since the notion that trial may be commenced in absentia still seems to shock most lawyers, it would hardly seem appropriate to impute knowledge that this will occur to their clients.\"  Starkey, Trial in Absentia, 54 N.Y.St.B.J. 30, 34, n. 28 (1982).  It is unlikely, on the other hand, \" 'that a defendant who flees from a courtroom in the midst of a trial—where judge, jury, witnesses and lawyers are present and ready to continue—would not know that as a consequence the trial could continue in his absence.' \"  Taylor v. United States, 414 U.S. 17, 20, 94 S.Ct. 194, 196, 38 L.Ed.2d 174 (1973), quoting from Chief Judge Coffin's opinion, 478 F.2d 689, 691 (CA1 1973), for the Court of Appeals in that case.  Moreover, a rule that allows an ongoing trial to continue when a defendant disappears deprives the defendant of the option of gambling on an acquittal knowing that he can terminate the trial if it seems that the verdict will go against him—an option that might otherwise appear preferable to the costly, perhaps unnecessary, path of becoming a fugitive from the outset.\n\n\n17\nThe language, history, and logic of Rule 43 support a straightforward interpretation that prohibits the trial in absentia of a defendant who is not present at the beginning of trial.  Because we find Rule 43 dispositive, we do not reach Crosby's claim that his trial in absentia was also prohibited by the Constitution.\n\n\n18\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n19\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

Ct. 2018 (2007)\nOFFICE OF SENATOR MARK DAYTON, Appellant,\nv.\nBrad HANSON.\nNo. 06-618.\nSupreme Court of United States.\nArgued April 24, 2007.\nDecided May 21, 2007.\n*2019 Thomas C. Goldstein, William F. Allen, Christopher M. Egleson, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, Washington, D.C., Jean M. Manning, Counsel of Record, Toby R. Hyman, Claudia A. Kostel, Dawn Bennett-Ingold, Office of Senate Chief Counsel for Employment, Washington, D.C., for Appellant.\nDouglas B. Huron, Richard A. Salzman, Tammany M. Kramer, Heeler, Huron, Chertkof, Lerner, Simon & Salzman, Washington, DC, for Appellee.\n*2020 Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\nPrior to January 3, 2007, Mark Dayton represented the State of Minnesota in the United States Senate. Appellee, Brad Hanson, was employed in the Senator's Ft. Snelling office prior to his discharge by the Senator, which he alleges occurred on July 3, 2002. Hanson brought this action for damages against appellant, the Senator's office (Office), invoking the District Court's jurisdiction under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (Act), 109 Stat. 3, as amended, 2 U.S.C. § 1301 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), and alleging violations of three other federal statutes.[1] The District Court denied appellant's motion to dismiss the complaint based on a claim of immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution.[2] The Court of Appeals affirmed, Fields v. Office of Eddie Bernice Johnson, Employing Office, United States Congress, 459 F.3d 1 (C.A.D.C. 2006), the Office invoked our appellate jurisdiction under § 412 of the Act, 2 U.S.C. § 1412, and we postponed consideration of jurisdiction pending hearing the case on the merits, 549 U.S. ___, ___ S.Ct. ___, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 75 USLW 3266 (2007). Because we do not have jurisdiction under § 412, we dismiss the appeal. Treating appellant's jurisdictional statement as a petition for a writ of certiorari, we deny the petition.\nUnder § 412 of the Act, direct review in this Court is available \"from any interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of a court upon the constitutionality of any provision\" of the statute.[3] Neither the order of the District Court denying appellant's motion to dismiss nor the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming that order can fairly be characterized as a ruling \"upon the constitutionality\" of any provision of the Act. The District Court's minute order denying the motion to dismiss does not state any grounds for decision. App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a. Both parties agree that that order cannot, therefore, be characterized as a constitutional holding.[4] The Court of Appeals' opinion rejects appellant's argument that forcing Senator Dayton to defend against the allegations in this case would necessarily *2021 contravene the Speech or Debate Clause, although it leaves open the possibility that the Speech or Debate Clause may limit the scope of the proceedings in some respects. Neither of those holdings qualifies as a ruling on the validity of the Act itself.\nThe Office argues that the Court of Appeals' holding amounts to a ruling that the Act is constitutional \"as applied.\" According to the Office, an \"as applied\" constitutional holding of that sort satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of § 412. We find this reading difficult to reconcile with the statutory scheme. Section 413 of the Act provides that\n\"[t]he authorization to bring judicial proceedings under [the Act] shall not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity for any other purpose, or of the privileges of any Senator or Member of the House of Representatives under [the Speech or Debate Clause] of the Constitution.\" 2 U.S.C. § 1413.\nThis provision demonstrates that Congress did not intend the Act to be interpreted to permit suits that would otherwise be prohibited under the Speech or Debate Clause. Consequently, a court's determination that jurisdiction attaches despite a claim of Speech or Debate Clause immunity is best read as a ruling on the scope of the Act, not its constitutionality. This reading is faithful, moreover, to our established practice of interpreting statutes to avoid constitutional difficulties.[5] See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381-382, 125 S. Ct. 716, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2005).\nThe provision for appellate review is best understood as responding to a congressional concern that if a provision of the statute is declared invalid there is an interest in prompt adjudication by this Court. To extend that review to instances in which the statute itself has not been called into question, giving litigants under the Act preference over litigants in other cases, does not accord with that rationale. This is also consistent with our cases holding that \"statutes authorizing appeals are to be strictly construed.\" Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 43, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1983); see also Fornaris v. Ridge Tool Co., 400 U.S. 41, 42, n. 1, 91 S. Ct. 156, 27 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1970) (per curiam).\nNor are there special circumstances that justify the exercise of our discretionary certiorari jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the interlocutory order entered by the District Court. Having abandoned its decision in Browning v. Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, 789 F.2d 923 (1986), the D.C. Circuit is no longer in obvious conflict with any other Circuit on the application of the Speech or Debate Clause to suits challenging the personnel decisions of Members of Congress. Compare 459 F.3d 1 (case below), with Bastien v. Office of Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, 390 F.3d 1301 (C.A.10 2004).\nAccordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction and certiorari is denied. We express no opinion on the merits, nor do we decide whether this action became moot upon the expiration of Senator Dayton's term in office.\nIt is so ordered.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nNOTES\n[1]  Appellee alleged violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 6, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.

CALVIN\n\n                O’NEIL JACKSON\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 12–694.   Decided June 3, 2013\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   In this case, the Court of Appeals held that respondent,\nwho was convicted of rape and other serious crimes, is en-\ntitled to relief under the federal habeas statute because\nthe Supreme Court of Nevada unreasonably applied clearly\nestablished Supreme Court precedent regarding a crim-\ninal defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense.\nAt his trial, respondent unsuccessfully sought to introduce\nevidence for the purpose of showing that the rape victim\npreviously reported that he had assaulted her but that\nthe police had been unable to substantiate those allega-\ntions. The state supreme court held that this evidence\nwas properly excluded, and no prior decision of this Court\nclearly establishes that the exclusion of this evidence\nviolated respondent’s federal constitutional rights. The\ndecision of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.\n                             I\n  Respondent Calvin Jackson had a tumultuous decade-\nlong romantic relationship with Annette Heathmon. In\n1998, after several previous attempts to end the relation-\nship, Heathmon relocated to a new apartment in North\nLas Vegas without telling respondent where she was mov-\ning. Respondent learned of Heathmon’s whereabouts,\nand on the night of October 21, 1998, he visited her\napartment. What happened next was the focus of re-\nspondent’s trial.\n  Heathmon told police and later testified that respondent\n2                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nforced his way into her apartment and threatened to kill\nher with a screwdriver if she did not have sex with him.\nAfter raping Heathmon, respondent hit her, stole a ring\nfrom her bedroom, and dragged her out of the apartment\nand toward his car by the neck and hair. A witness con-\nfronted the couple, and respondent fled. Police observed\ninjuries to Heathmon’s neck and scalp that were consis-\ntent with her account of events, and respondent was even-\ntually arrested.\n  Although respondent did not testify at trial, he dis-\ncussed Heathmon’s allegations with police shortly after his\narrest, and his statements were admitted into evidence\nat trial. Respondent acknowledged that Heathmon might\nhave agreed to have sex because the two were alone and\n“she was scared that [he] might do something,” Tr. 305,\nbut he claimed that the sex was consensual. Respondent\nalso admitted striking Heathmon inside the apartment\nbut denied pulling her outside by the neck and hair.\n  Shortly before trial, Heathmon sent the judge a letter\nrecanting her prior accusations and stating that she would\nnot testify. She went into hiding, but police eventually\nfound her and took her into custody as a material wit-\nness. Once in custody, Heathmon disavowed the letter and\nagreed to testify. When asked about the letter at trial, she\nstated that three of respondent’s associates had forced her\nto write it and had threatened to hurt her if she appeared\nin court.\n  At trial, the theory of the defense was that Heathmon\nhad fabricated the sexual assault and had reported it to\npolice in an effort to control respondent. To support that\ntheory, the defense sought to introduce testimony and\npolice reports showing that Heathmon had called the\npolice on several prior occasions claiming that respondent\nhad raped or otherwise assaulted her. Police were unable\nto corroborate many of these prior allegations, and in\nseveral cases they were skeptical of her claims. Although\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthe trial court gave the defense wide latitude to cross-\nexamine Heathmon about those prior incidents, it refused\nto admit the police reports or to allow the defense to call as\nwitnesses the officers involved. The jury found respondent\nguilty, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n   Respondent appealed his conviction to the Nevada Su-\npreme Court, arguing, among other things, that the trial\ncourt’s refusal to admit extrinsic evidence relating to the\nprior incidents violated his federal constitutional right\nto present a complete defense, but the Nevada Supreme\nCourt rejected that argument.\n   After exhausting his remedies in state court, respondent\nfiled a federal habeas petition, again arguing that the trial\ncourt’s ruling had violated his right to present a defense.\nApplying AEDPA’s deferential standard of review, the\nDistrict Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the\nNinth Circuit reversed. 688 F.3d 1091 (2012). The major-\nity held that extrinsic evidence of Heathmon’s prior alle-\ngations was critical to respondent’s defense, that the\nexclusion of that evidence violated respondent’s constitu-\ntional right to present a defense, and that the Nevada\nSupreme Court’s decision to the contrary was an unrea-\nsonable application of this Court’s precedents. Id., at\n1097–1101. Although it acknowledged that the state court\nhad ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter\nof state law, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the impact\nof the State’s rules of evidence on the defense “was dispro-\nportionate to the state’s interest in . . . exclusion.” Id., at\n1101–1104. Finding that the trial court’s erroneous evi-\ndentiary ruling was not harmless, id., at 1104–1106, the\nNinth Circuit ordered the State either to retry or to re-\nlease respondent.\n                         II\n  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) authorizes a federal habeas court to grant\n4                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nrelief to a prisoner whose state court conviction “involved\nan unreasonable application of . . . clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States.” 28 U.S. C. §2254(d)(1). It is settled that\na federal habeas court may overturn a state court’s appli-\ncation of federal law only if it is so erroneous that “there\nis no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the\nstate court’s decision conflicts with this Court’s prece-\ndents.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 13). Applying that deferential standard, we\nconclude that the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision was\nreasonable.\n   “[T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants ‘a\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense,’ ”\nCrane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690 (1986) (quoting\nCalifornia v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984)), but\nwe have also recognized that “ ‘state and federal rulemak-\ners have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish\nrules excluding evidence from criminal trials,’ ” Holmes v.\nSouth Carolina, 547 U.S. 319, 324 (2006) (quoting United\nStates v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 308 (1998)). Only rarely\nhave we held that the right to present a complete defense\nwas violated by the exclusion of defense evidence under a\nstate rule of evidence. See 547 U. S., at 331 (rule did not\nrationally serve any discernible purpose); Rock v. Arkan-\nsas, 483 U.S. 44, 61 (1987) (rule arbitrary); Chambers v.\nMississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302–303 (1973) (State did not\neven attempt to explain the reason for its rule); Washing-\nton v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 22 (1967) (rule could not be\nrationally defended).\n   As the Ninth Circuit conceded, “[t]he Nevada Supreme\nCourt recognized and applied the correct legal principle.”\n688 F. 3d, at 1097. But contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s\nconclusion, the State Supreme Court’s application of our\nclearly established precedents was reasonable. The start-\ning point in the state court’s analysis was a state statute\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthat generally precludes the admission of extrinsic evi-\ndence of “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness,\nfor the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’\ncredibility, other than conviction of crime.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 66; see Nev. Rev. Stat. §50.085(3) (2011). The\npurpose of that rule, the Nevada Supreme Court has\nexplained, “is to focus the fact-finder on the most impor-\ntant facts and conserve ‘judicial resources by avoiding mini-\ntrials on collateral issues.’ ” Abbott v. State, 122 Nev.\n715, 736, 138 P.3d 462, 476 (2006) (quoting State v. Long,\n140 S.W.3d 27, 30 (Mo. 2004)). These are “good rea-\nson[s]” for limiting the use of extrinsic evidence, Clark v.\nArizona, 548 U.S. 735, 770 (2006), and the Nevada statute\nis akin to the widely accepted rule of evidence law that\ngenerally precludes the admission of evidence of specific\ninstances of a witness’ conduct to prove the witness’ char-\nacter for untruthfulness. See Fed. Rule Evid. 608(b); C.\nMueller & L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §6.27, pp. 497–499\n(4th ed. 2009). The constitutional propriety of this rule\ncannot be seriously disputed.\n   As an exception to the prohibition contained in Nev.\nRev. Stat. §50.085(3), the Nevada Supreme Court held in\nMiller v. State, 105 Nev. 497, 499–500, 779 P.2d 87, 88–89\n(1989), that “in a sexual assault case defense counsel may\ncross-examine a complaining witness about previous fab-\nricated sexual assault accusations and, if the witness\ndenies making the allegations, may introduce extrinsic\nevidence to prove that fabricated charges were made by\nthat witness in the past.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 66. But in\norder to introduce evidence showing that the witness\npreviously made false allegations, the defendant must file\nwritten notice, and the trial court must hold a hearing.\nMiller, supra, at 501, 779 P. 2d, at 90. Respondent did not\nfile the requisite notice, and the State Supreme Court\nupheld the exclusion of evidence of prior sexual assault\ncomplaints on this basis.\n6                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n  No decision of this Court clearly establishes that this\nnotice requirement is unconstitutional. Nor, contrary to\nthe reasoning of the Ninth Circuit majority, see 688 F.\n3d, at 1103–1104, do our cases clearly establish that the\nConstitution requires a case-by-case balancing of interests\nbefore such a rule can be enforced. The decision on which\nthe Ninth Circuit relied, Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U.S. 145\n(1991), is very far afield. In that case, we reversed a\ndecision holding that the Sixth Amendment categorically\nprohibits the enforcement of a rule that required a rape\ndefendant to provide pretrial notice if he wished to intro-\nduce evidence of his prior sexual relationship with the\ncomplaining witness. The Court did not even suggest,\nmuch less hold, that it is unconstitutional to enforce such\na rule unless a case-by-case balancing of interests weighs\nin favor of enforcement. Instead, the Court “express[ed]\nno opinion as to whether or not preclusion was justified in\nth[at] case” and left it for the state courts to address that\nquestion in the first instance. Id., at 153. No fair-minded\njurist could think that Lucas clearly establishes that the\nenforcement of the Nevada rule in this case is inconsistent\nwith the Constitution.\n  Some of the evidence that respondent sought to in-\ntroduce concerned prior incidents in which the victim re-\nported that respondent beat her up but did not sexually\nassault her, and the state supreme court did not view its\nMiller decision as applying in such circumstances. But the\nstate court did not simply invoke the rule set out in Nev.\nRev. Stat. §50.085(3). Rather, the court reasoned that the\nproffered evidence had little impeachment value because\nat most it showed simply that the victim’s reports could\nnot be corroborated. The admission of extrinsic evidence\nof specific instances of a witness’ conduct to impeach the\nwitness’ credibility may confuse the jury, unfairly embar-\nrass the victim, surprise the prosecution, and unduly\nprolong the trial. No decision of this Court clearly estab-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlishes that the exclusion of such evidence for such reasons\nin a particular case violates the Constitution.\n   In holding that respondent is entitled to habeas relief,\nthe Ninth Circuit pointed to two of its own AEDPA deci-\nsions in which it granted habeas relief to state prisoners\nwho were not allowed to conduct a full cross-examination\nof the witnesses against them. 688 F. 3d, at 1098–1101\n(discussing Fowler v. Sacramento Cty. Sheriff ’s Dept., 421\nF.3d 1027, 1035–1038 (CA9 2005) and Holley v. Yar-\nborough, 568 F.3d 1091, 1098–1101 (CA9 2009)). Those\ncases in turn relied on Supreme Court decisions holding\nthat various restrictions on a defendant’s ability to cross-\nexamine witnesses violate the Confrontation Clause of the\nSixth Amendment. See, e.g., Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S.\n227, 231 (1988) (per curiam); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475\nU.S. 673, 678–679 (1986); Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S.\n308, 315–316 (1974). But this Court has never held that\nthe Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to\nintroduce extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes.\nSee Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 22 (1985)\n(per curiam) (observing that “the Confrontation Clause is\ngenerally satisfied when the defense is given a full and\nfair opportunity to . . . expose [testimonial] infirmities\nthrough cross-examination”). See also Jordan v. Warden,\n675 F.3d 586, 596 (CA6 2012); Brown v. Ruane, 630 F.3d\n62, 70 (CA1 2011).\n   The Ninth Circuit elided the distinction between cross-\nexamination and extrinsic evidence by characterizing the\ncases as recognizing a broad right to present “evidence\nbearing on [a witness’] credibility.” 688 F. 3d, at 1099. By\nframing our precedents at such a high level of generality,\na lower federal court could transform even the most imag-\ninative extension of existing case law into “clearly estab-\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.”\n28 U.S. C. §2254(d)(1). In thus collapsing the distinction\nbetween “an unreasonable application of federal law” and\n8                   NEVADA v. JACKSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nwhat a lower court believes to be “an incorrect or erroneous\napplication of federal law,” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.\n362, 412 (2000), the Ninth Circuit’s approach would defeat\nthe substantial deference that AEDPA requires.\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

ERICKSON, Jr., et al.\nNo. 96-1395.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nArgued Dec. 2, 1997.\nDecided Jan. 21, 1998.**\n\n\nSyllabus\n*\n\nRespondents, federal employees subject to adverse actions by their agencies, each made false statements to agency investigators with respect to the misconduct with which they were charged.  In each case, the agency additionally charged the false statement as a ground for adverse action, and the action taken against the employee was based in part on the added charge.  The  Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) upheld that portion of each penalty that was based on the underlying charge, but overturned the false statement portion, ruling, inter alia, that  the claimed statement could not be considered in setting the appropriate punishment.  In separate appeals, the Federal Circuit agreed with the Board that no penalty could be based on a false denial of the underlying claim.\nHeld: Neither the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause nor the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. §1101 et seq., precludes a federal agency from sanctioning an employee for making false statements to the agency regarding his alleged employment-related misconduct.  It is impossible to square the result reached below with the holding in, e.g., Bryson v. United States, 396 U.S. 64, 72, 90 S.Ct. 355, 360, 24 L.Ed.2d 264, that a citizen may decline to answer a Government question, or answer it honestly, but cannot with impunity knowingly and willfully answer it with a falsehood. There is no hint of a right to falsely deny charged conduct in §7513(a), which authorizes an agency to impose the sort of penalties involved here \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,'' and then accords the employee four carefully delineated procedural rights-advance written notice of the charges, a reasonable time to answer, legal representation, and a specific written decision.  Nor can such a  right be found in due process, the core of which is the right to  notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.  Even assuming that respondents had a protected property interest in their employment, this Court rejects, both on the basis of precedent and principle, the Federal Circuit's view that a \"meaningful opportunity to be heard'' includes a right to make false statements with respect to the charged conduct.  It is well established that a criminal defendant's right to testify does not include the right to commit perjury, e.g., Nix v. Whiteside, 475  U.S. 157, 173, 106 S.Ct. 988, 997, 89 L.Ed.2d 123, and that punishment may constitutionally be imposed, e.g., United States v. Wong, 431 U.S. 174, 178, 97 S.Ct. 1823, 1825-1826, 52 L.Ed.2d  231, or enhanced, e.g., United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 97, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1118, 122 L.Ed.2d 445, because of perjury or  the filing of a false affidavit required by statute, e.g., Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973.  The fact that respondents were not under oath is irrelevant, since they were not charged with perjury, but with making false statements during an agency investigation, a charge that does not require sworn statements.  Moreover, any claim that employees not allowed to make false statements might be coerced into admitting  misconduct, whether they believe that they are guilty or not, in  order to avoid the more severe penalty of removal for falsification is entirely frivolous. United States v. Grayson, 438 U.S. 41, 55, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2618, 57 L.Ed.2d 582.  If answering an agency's investigatory question could expose an employee to a criminal prosecution, he may exercise his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.  See, e.g., Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 67, 26 S.Ct. 370, 376, 50 L.Ed. 652.  An agency, in ascertaining the truth or falsity of the charge, might take that  failure to respond into consideration, see Baxter v. Palmigiano,  425 U.S. 308, 318, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 1558, 47 L.Ed.2d 810, but there is nothing inherently irrational about such an investigative posture, see Konigsberg v. State Bar of Cal., 366 U.S. 36, 81 S.Ct. 997, 6 L.Ed.2d 105. Pp. ___-___.\n89 F.3d 1575 (C.A.Fed.1996) (first judgment), and 92 F.3d 1208 (C.A.Fed.1996) (second judgment), reversed.\nREHNQUIST, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nSeth P. Waxman, Washington, DC, for petitioner.\nPaul E. Marth, Greeensboro, NC, for respondents.\nChief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe question presented by this case is whether either the Due Process Clause or the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), 5 U.S.C. §1101 et seq., precludes a federal agency from sanctioning an employee for making false statements to the agency regarding alleged employment-related misconduct on the part of the employee. We hold that they do not.\n\n\n2\nRespondents Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, Roberts, and McManus are government employees who were the subject of adverse actions by the various agencies for which they worked.  Each employee made false statements to agency investigators with respect to the misconduct with which they were charged.  In each case, the agency additionally charged the false statement as a ground for adverse action, and the action taken in each was based in part on the added charge.  The employees separately appealed the actions taken against them to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board).  The Board upheld that portion of the penalty based on the underlying charge in each case, but overturned the false statement charge.  The Board further held that an employee's false statements could not be used for purposes of impeaching the employee's credibility, nor could they be considered in setting the appropriate punishment for the employee's underlying misconduct.  Finally, the Board held that an agency may not charge an employee with failure to report an act of fraud when reporting such fraud would tend to implicate the employee in employment-related misconduct.\n\n\n3\nThe Director of the Office of Personnel Management appealed each of these decisions by the Board to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  In a consolidated appeal involving the cases of Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, and Roberts, that court agreed with the Board that no penalty could be based on a false denial of the underlying claim. King v. Erickson, 89 F.3d 1575 (1996). Citing the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the court held that \"an agency may not charge an employee with falsification or a similar charge on the ground of the employee's denial of another charge or of underlying facts relating to that  other charge,'' nor may \" [d]enials of charges and related facts  . . .  be considered in determining a penalty.'' Id., at 1585.  In a separate unpublished decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's reversal of the false statement charge against McManus as well as the Board's conclusion that an employee's \"false statements  . . .  may not be considered'' even for purposes of impeachment. McManus v. Department of Justice, 66 M.S.P.R. 564, 568 (1995).\n\n\n4\nWe granted certiorari in both cases, 521 U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2506, 138 L.Ed.2d 1011 (1997), and now reverse.  In Bryson  v. United States, 396 U.S. 64, 90 S.Ct. 355, 24 L.Ed.2d 264 (1969), we said: \"Our legal system provides methods for challenging the Government's right to ask questions-lying is not  one of them.  A citizen may decline to answer the question, or answer it honestly, but he cannot with impunity knowingly and willfully answer with a falsehood.'' Id., at 72, 90 S.Ct., at 360 (footnote omitted).  We find it impossible to square the result reached by the Court of Appeals in the present case with our holding in Bryson and in other cases of similar import.\n\n\n5\nTitle 5 U.S.C. §7513(a) provides that an agency may impose the sort of penalties involved here \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.''  It then sets forth four procedural rights accorded to the employee against whom adverse action is proposed.  The agency must:\n\n\n6\n(1)  give the employee \"at least 30 days' advance written      notice''; (2) allow the employee \"a reasonable time, but not      less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to      furnish  . . .  evidence in support of the answer''; (3)      permit the employee to \"be represented by an attorney or      other representative''; and (4) provide the employee with \"a      written decision and the specific reasons therefor.'' 5      U.S.C. §7513(b).\n\n\n7\nIn these carefully delineated rights there is no hint of any right to \"put the government to its proof'' by falsely denying the charged conduct.  Such a right, then, if it exists at all, must come from the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\n\n8\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that \" [n]o person shall  . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law  . . . .'' U.S. Const., Amend. V.  The Court of Appeals stated that \"it is undisputed that the government employees here  had a protected property interest in their employment,'' 89 F.3d, at 1581, and we assume that to be the case for purposes of our decision.\n\n\n9\nThe core of due process is the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1493, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).  But we reject, on the basis of both precedent and principle, the view expressed by the Court of Appeals in this case that a \"meaningful opportunity to be heard'' includes a right to make false statements with respect to the charged conduct.\n\n\n10\nIt is well established that a criminal defendant's right to testify does not include the right to commit perjury. Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157, 173, 106 S.Ct. 988, 997, 89 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986); United States v. Havens, 446 U.S. 620, 626, 100 S.Ct. 1912, 1916, 64 L.Ed.2d 559 (1980); United States v. Grayson, 438 U.S. 41, 54, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2617-2618, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978). Indeed, in United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 97, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1118, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993), we held that a court could, consistent with the Constitution, enhance a criminal defendant's sentence based on a finding that he perjured himself at trial.\n\n\n11\nWitnesses appearing before a grand jury under oath are likewise required to testify truthfully, on pain of being prosecuted for perjury. United States v. Wong, 431 U.S. 174, 97 S.Ct. 1823, 52 L.Ed.2d 231 (1977).  There we said that \"the predicament of being forced to choose between incriminatory truth and falsehood  . . .  does not justify perjury.'' Id., at 178, 97 S.Ct., at 1826.  Similarly, one who files a false affidavit required by statute may be fined and imprisoned. Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966).\n\n\n12\nThe Court of Appeals sought to distinguish these cases on the ground that the defendants in them had been under oath, while here the respondents were not.  The fact that respondents were not under oath, of course, negates a charge of perjury, but that  is not the charge brought against them.  They were charged with making false statements during the course of an agency investigation, a charge that does not require that the statements be made under oath.  While the Court of Appeals would apparently permit the imposition of punishment for the former but not the latter, we fail to see how the presence or absence of an oath is material to the due process inquiry.\n\n\n13\nThe Court of Appeals also relied on its fear that if employees were not allowed to make false statements, they might \"be coerced into admitting the misconduct, whether they believe that they are guilty or not, in order to avoid the more severe penalty of removal possibly resulting from a falsification charge.''  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a-17a.  But we rejected a similar claim in United States v. Grayson, 438 U.S. 41, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978).  There a sentencing judge took into consideration his belief that the defendant had testified falsely at his trial.  The defendant argued before us that such a practice would inhibit the exercise of the right to testify truthfully in the proceeding.  We described that contention as \"entirely frivolous.'' Id., at 55, 98 S.Ct., at 2618.\n\n\n14\nIf answering an agency's investigatory question could expose an employee to a criminal prosecution, he may exercise his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.  See Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 67, 26 S.Ct. 370, 376, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906); United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 2641, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980).  It may well be that an agency, in ascertaining the truth or falsity of the charge, would take into consideration the failure of the employee to respond.  See Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 1558, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976) (discussing the \"prevailing rule that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify'').  But there is nothing inherently irrational about such an investigative posture.  See Konigsberg v. State Bar of Cal., 366 U.S. 36, 81 S.Ct. 997, 6 L.Ed.2d 105 (1961).\n\n\n15\nFor these reasons, we hold that a government agency may take adverse action against an employee because the employee made false statements in response to an underlying charge of misconduct.  The judgments of the Court of Appeals are therefore\n\n\n16\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n**\n Together with LaChance, Acting Director, Office of Personnel Management v. McManus et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n\n\n*\nThe syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

McGill, Deceased.\nNo. 95-1225.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nArgued Dec. 3, 1996.\nDecided Feb. 18, 1997*.\n\n\nSyllabus\n**\n\nAfter the taxpayer in each of these cases paid the Internal Revenue Service money he did not owe, he (or his representative) submitted an administrative refund claim several years past the end of the applicable filing period set forth in §6511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Each taxpayer asked the court to extend the statutory period for an \"equitable'' reason, namely that he had a mental disability (senility or alcoholism) that caused the delay.  Such a reason is not mentioned in §6511, but, in both cases, the Ninth Circuit read the statute as if it contained an implied \"equitable tolling'' exception.  It then applied equity principles to each case, found that those principles justified tolling the statutory period, and permitted the actions to proceed.\nHeld: Congress did not intend the \"equitable tolling'' doctrine to apply to §6511's time (and related amount) limitations for filing tax refund claims.  The taxpayers misplace their reliance  on Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 94-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 456-458, 112 L.Ed.2d 435.  Even assuming, as they contend, that a tax refund suit and a private restitution suit are sufficiently similar to warrant asking Irwin's negatively phrased question-Is there good reason to believe that Congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply in a suit against the Government?-there are strong reasons for answering that question in the Government's favor.  Section 6511 sets forth its time limitations in a highly detailed technical manner, reiterates them several times in different ways, imposes substantive limitations, and sets forth explicit exceptions to its basic time limits that do not include \"equitable tolling.''   To read such tolling into these provisions would require one to assume an implied tolling exception virtually every time a number appears in §6511, and would require the tolling of that section's substantive limitations on the amount of recovery-a kind of tolling for which there is no direct precedent.  There are no counter-indications of congressional intent.  Reading \"equitable tolling'' into the statute could create serious administrative problems by forcing the IRS to respond to, and perhaps litigate, large numbers of late claims.  That fact suggests that, at the least, Congress would likely have wanted to decide explicitly whether, or just where and when, to expand the statute's limitations periods, rather than delegate to the courts a generalized power to do so wherever it appears that equity so requires.  The taxpayers' counter-rebuttal, consisting primarily of a historical analysis of the tax refund provisions, actually helps the Government's argument.  Pp. ___-___.\n67 F.3d 260 and 70 F.3d 120, reversed.\nBREYER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nLawrence G. Wallace, Washington, DC, for petitioner.\nRobert F. Klueger, Encino, CA, for respondents.\nJustice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe two cases before us raise a single question.  Can courts toll, for nonstatutory equitable reasons, the statutory time (and related amount) limitations for filing tax refund claims set forth in §6511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986?  We hold that they cannot.\n\n\n2\nThese two cases present similar circumstances.  In each case a taxpayer initially paid the Internal Revenue Service several thousand dollars that he did not owe.  In each case the taxpayer (or his representative) filed an administrative claim for refund several years after the relevant statutory time period for doing so had ended.  In each case the taxpayer suffered a disability (senility or alcoholism), which, he said, explained why the delay was not his fault.  And in each case he asked the court to extend the relevant statutory time period for an \"equitable'' reason, namely the existence of a mental disability-a reason not mentioned in §6511, but which, we assume, would permit a court to toll the statutory limitations period if, but only if, §6511 contains an implied \"equitable tolling'' exception.  See 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1056 (2d ed.1987 and Supp.1996); see also Wolin v. Smith Barney, Inc., 83 F.3d 847, 852 (C.A.7 1996) (defining equitable tolling).\n\n\n3\nIn both cases, the Ninth Circuit read §6511 as if it did contain an implied exception that would permit \"equitable tolling.''  It then applied principles of equity to each case.  It found those principles justified tolling the statutory time period.  And it permitted the actions to proceed. 67 F.3d 260 (1995); judgt. order reported at 70 F.3d 120 (1995).  All other Circuits that have considered the matter, however, have taken the opposite view.  They have held that §6511 does not authorize equitable tolling.  See Amoco Production Co. v. Newton Sheep Co., 85 F.3d 1464 (C.A.10 1996); Lovett v. United States, 81 F.3d 143 (C.A.Fed.1996); Webb v. United States, 66 F.3d 691 (C.A.4 1995); Oropallo v. United States, 994 F.2d 25 (C.A.1 1993) (per curiam); and Vintilla v. United States, 931 F.2d 1444 (C.A.11 1991).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.  And we conclude that the latter Circuits are correct.\n\n\n4\nThe taxpayers rest their claim for equitable tolling upon Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), a case in which this Court considered the timeliness of an employee's lawsuit charging his Government employer with discrimination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq. The Court found the lawsuit untimely, but nevertheless tolled the limitations period.  It held that the \"rule of equitable tolling'' applies \"to suits against the Government, in the same way that it is applicable'' to Title VII suits against private employers. 498 U.S., at 94-95, 111 S.Ct., at 456-457.  The Court  went on to say that the \"same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States.'' Id., at 95-96, 111 S.Ct., at 457.\n\n\n5\nThe taxpayers, pointing to Irwin, argue that principles of equitable tolling would have applied had they sued private defendants, e.g., had they sought restitution from private defendants for \"Money Had and Received.''  See C. Keigwin, Cases in Common Law Pleading 220 (2d ed. 1934).  They add that given Irwin's language, there must be a \"presumption'' that limitations periods in tax refund suits against the Government can be equitably tolled.  And, they say, that \"presumption,'' while \"rebuttable,'' has not been rebutted.  They conclude that, given Irwin, the Ninth Circuit correctly tolled the statutory period for \"equitable'' reasons.\n\n\n6\nIn evaluating this argument, we are willing to assume, favorably to the taxpayers but only for argument's sake, that a tax refund suit and a private suit for restitution are sufficiently similar to warrant asking Irwin's negatively phrased question: Is there good reason to believe that Congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply?  But see Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145, 153-154, 80 S.Ct. 630, 634-635, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960) (citing Curtis's Administratrix v. Fiedler, 2 Black 461, 479, 17 L.Ed. 273 (1863)) (distinguishing common-law suit against the tax collector from action of assumpsit for money had and received); George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U.S. 373, 382-383, 53 S.Ct. 620, 623-624, 77 L.Ed. 1265 (1933); see also Plumb, Tax Refund Suits Against Collectors of Internal Revenue, 60 Harv.L.Rev. 685, 687 (1947) (describing collector suit as a fiction solely designed to bring the Government into court). We can travel no further, however, along Irwin's road, for there are strong reasons for answering Irwin's question in the Government's favor.\n\n\n7\nSection 6511 sets forth its time limitations in unusually emphatic form.  Ordinarily limitations statutes use fairly simple language, which one can often plausibly read as containing an implied \"equitable tolling'' exception.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §2000e-16(c) (requiring suit for employment discrimination to be filed \" [w]ithin 90 days of receipt of notice of final [EEOC] action  . . . '').  But §6511 uses language that is not simple. It sets forth its limitations in a highly detailed technical manner, that linguistically speaking, cannot easily be read as containing implicit exceptions.  Moreover, §6511 reiterates its limitations several times in several different ways.  Section 6511 says, first, that a\n\n\n8\n\" [c]laim for  . . .  refund  . . .  of any tax  . . .  shall      be filed by the taxpayer within 3 years from the time  the      return was filed or 2 years from the time the tax was paid,      whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no  return      was filed  . . .  within 2 years from the time the tax was      paid.'' 26 U.S.C. §6511(a).\n\nIt then says that\n\n9\n\" [n]o credit or refund shall be allowed or made after the      expiration of the period of limitation prescribed  . . .      unless a claim for  . . .  refund is filed  . . .  within      such period.'' —§6511(b)(1).\n\n\n10\nIt reiterates the point by imposing substantive limitations:\n\n\n11\n\"If the claim was filed by the taxpayer during the 3-year      period  . . .  the amount of the credit or refund shall not      exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period,      immediately preceding the filing of the claim, equal to 3      years plus the period of any extension of time for filing the      return  . . . . '' —§6511(b)(2)(A).\n\nAnd\n\n12\n\" [i]f the claim was not filed within such 3-year period, the      amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion      of the tax paid during the 2 years immediately preceding the      filing of the claim.'' —§6511(b)(2)(B).\n\n\n13\nThe Tax Code reemphasizes the point when it says that refunds that do not comply with these limitations \"shall be considered erroneous,'' §6514, and specifies procedures for the Government's recovery of any such \"erroneous'' refund payment. —§§6532(b), 7405.  In addition, §6511 sets forth explicit exceptions to its basic time limits, and those very specific exceptions do not include \"equitable tolling.''  See §6511(d) (establishing special time limit rules for refunds related to operating losses, credit carrybacks, foreign taxes, self-employment taxes, worthless securities, and bad debts); see also United States v. Dalm, 494 U.S. 596, 610, 110 S.Ct. 1361, 1369, 108 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990) (discussing mitigation provisions set forth in 26 U.S.C. §§1311-1314); §507 of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 961 (temporarily tolling limitations period during wartime).\n\n\n14\nTo read an \"equitable tolling'' provision into these provisions, one would have to assume an implied exception for tolling virtually every time a number appears.  To do so would work a kind of linguistic havoc.  Moreover, such an interpretation would require tolling, not only procedural limitations, but also substantive limitations on the amount of recovery-a kind of tolling for which we have found no direct precedent.  Section 6511's detail, its technical language, the iteration of the limitations in both procedural and substantive forms, and the explicit listing of exceptions, taken together indicate to us that Congress did not intend courts to read other  unmentioned, open-ended, \"equitable'' exceptions into the statute that it wrote.  There are no counter-indications.  Tax law, after all, is not normally characterized by case-specific exceptions reflecting individualized equities.\n\n\n15\nThe nature of the underlying subject matter-tax collection-underscores the linguistic point.  The IRS processes more than 200 million tax returns each year.  It issues more than 90 million refunds.  See Dept. of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, 1995 Data Book 8-9.  To read an \"equitable tolling'' exception into §6511 could create serious administrative problems by forcing the IRS to respond to, and perhaps litigate, large numbers of late claims, accompanied by requests for \"equitable tolling'' which, upon close inspection, might turn out to lack sufficient equitable justification.  See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 41 (1926) (deleting provision excusing tax deficiencies in the estates of insane or deceased individuals because of difficulties involved in defining incompetence).  The nature and potential magnitude of the administrative problem suggest that Congress decided to pay the price of occasional unfairness in individual cases (penalizing a taxpayer whose claim is unavoidably delayed) in order to maintain a more workable tax enforcement system.  At the least it tells us that Congress would likely have wanted to decide explicitly whether, or just where and when, to expand the statute's limitations periods, rather than delegate to the courts a generalized power to do so wherever a court concludes that equity so requires.\n\n\n16\nThe taxpayers' counter-rebuttal consists primarily of an interesting historical analysis of the Internal Revenue Code's tax refund provisions.  They try to show that §6511's specific, detailed language reflects congressional concern about matters not related to equitable tolling.  They explain some language, for example, in terms of a congressional effort to stop taxpayers from keeping the refund period open indefinitely through the device of making a series of small tax payments.  See S.Rep. No.  398, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 33 (1924).  They explain other language as an effort to make the refund time period and the tax  assessment period coextensive.  See H.R.Rep. No. 2333, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 52 (1942).  Assuming all that is so, however, such congressional efforts still seem but a smaller part of a larger congressional objective: providing the Government with strong statutory \"protection against stale demands.''  Cf. United States v. Garbutt Oil Co., 302 U.S. 528, 533, 58 S.Ct. 320, 323,  82 L.Ed. 405 (1938) (statute of limitations bars untimely amendment of claim for additional refund).  Moreover, the history to which the taxpayers point reveals that §6511's predecessor tax refund provisions, like §6511, contained highly detailed language with clear time limits.  See, e.g., §281(b) of the Revenue Act of 1924, ch. 234, 43 Stat. 301 (4-year limit on claims for overpayment of income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax and cap on refund amount); §322(b) of the Revenue Act of 1932, ch. 209, 47 Stat. 242 (2-year limit for claim filing and corresponding limit on refund amount); Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A Stat. 808 (adopting current alternative time and amount limitations); see also §810 of the Revenue Act of 1932, ch. 209, 47 Stat. 283 (imposing time and amount limits for estate tax refunds).  And that history lacks any instance (but for the present cases) of equitable tolling.  On balance, these historical considerations help the Government's argument.\n\n\n17\nFor these reasons, we conclude that Congress did not intend the \"equitable tolling'' doctrine to apply to §6511's time limitations.  The Ninth Circuit's decisions are\n\n\n18\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n*\nTogether with United States v.

Decided May 2, 2011 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   An Ohio jury convicted respondent Harry Mitts on two\ncounts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted\nmurder. He was sentenced to death. At issue here is part\nof the jury instructions given during the penalty phase of\nMitts’s trial. The instructions, in pertinent part, were as\nfollows:\n    “[Y]ou must determine beyond a reasonable doubt\n    whether the aggravating circumstances, which [Mitts]\n    was found guilty of committing in the separate counts,\n    are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors you\n    find are present in this case.\n       “When all 12 members of the jury find by proof be\n    yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum\n    stances in each separate count with which [Mitts] has\n    been found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigat\n    ing factors, if any, then you must return such finding\n    to the Court.\n       “I instruct you as a matter of law that if you make\n    such a finding, then you must recommend to the\n    Court that the sentence of death be imposed on\n    [Mitts].\n         .           .          .           .           .\n       “On the other hand, [if] after considering all the\n    relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and tes\n    timony received at this hearing and the arguments of\n    counsel, you find that the state of Ohio failed to prove\n2                      BOBBY v.

Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 7). See Mitts v. Bagley, 620 F.3d 650, 652\n(CA6 2010) (noting that the “instructions in this case are\nthe same Ohio instructions that were given in” Spisak).\nThat case, like this one, involved review of a federal ha\nbeas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). AEDPA provides, as rele\nvant here, that relief may not be granted unless the state\ncourt adjudication “resulted in a decision that was con\ntrary to . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined\nby the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U.S. C.\n§2254(d)(1).\n   In Spisak, we reversed a Court of Appeals decision that\nhad found these instructions invalid under our decision in\nMills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367 (1988). See 558 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 8–9). Up until our decision in Spisak,\nMitts had also pressed the claim that the instructions\nwere invalid under Mills. After Spisak rejected that\nclaim, the Court of Appeals in this case determined that\nthe instructions were contrary to our decision in Beck v.\nAlabama, 447 U.S. 625 (1980), and accordingly vacated\nMitts’s death sentence. See 620 F.3d, at 658.\n   In Beck, we held that the death penalty may not be\nimposed “when the jury was not permitted to consider a\nverdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and\nwhen the evidence would have supported such a verdict.”\n447 U.S., at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\nexplained that such a scheme intolerably enhances the\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n“risk of an unwarranted conviction” because it “interjects\nirrelevant considerations into the factfinding process,\ndiverting the jury’s attention from the central issue of\nwhether the State has satisfied its burden of proving\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a\ncapital crime.” Id., at 638, 642. “[F]orcing the jury to\nchoose between conviction on the capital offense and ac\nquittal,” we observed, “may encourage the jury to convict\nfor an impermissible reason—its belief that the defendant\nis guilty of some serious crime and should be punished,”\neven when there is “some doubt with respect to an ele\nment” of the capital offense. Id., at 632, 642, 637. Be\ncause the scheme in Beck created a danger that the jury\nwould resolve any doubts in favor of conviction, we con\ncluded that it violated due process. See id., at 638, 643.\n   According to the Court of Appeals below, the penalty\nphase instructions given at Mitts’s trial—and the Supreme\nCourt of Ohio decision upholding their use—were “con\ntrary to” Beck, because they “interposed before the jury\nthe same false choice” that our holding in Beck prohibits.\n620 F.3d, at 658, 657 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nReferring to the instructions as “acquittal-first,” the Court\nof Appeals stated that they impermissibly required the\njury to first decide whether to “acquit” Mitts of the death\npenalty before considering “mercy and some form of life\nimprisonment.” Id., at 656–657. Interpreting Beck to\nstand for the proposition that “a jury instruction violates\ndue process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sen\ntence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the\njury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment,” the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the instructions given\nduring the penalty phase of Mitts’s trial unconstitutionally\n“deprived the jury of a meaningful opportunity to con\nsider” a life sentence. 620 F.3d, at 658, 657 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   The instructions here are surely not invalid under our\n4                     BOBBY v. MITTS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndecision in Beck. The concern addressed in Beck was “the\nrisk of an unwarranted conviction” created when the jury\nis forced to choose between finding the defendant guilty of\na capital offense and declaring him innocent of any\nwrongdoing. 447 U.S., at 637 (emphasis added); id., at\n638; see also Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 455\n(1984) (explaining that the “goal of the Beck rule” is “to\neliminate the distortion of the factfinding process that is\ncreated when the jury is forced into an all-or-nothing\nchoice between capital murder and innocence”); Schad v.\nArizona, 501 U.S. 624, 646 (1991) (“Our fundamental\nconcern in Beck was that a jury convinced that the defen\ndant had committed some violent crime but not convinced\nthat he was guilty of a capital crime might nonetheless\nvote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to\nset the defendant free with no punishment at all”).\n   The question here, however, concerns the penalty phase,\nnot the guilt phase, and we have already concluded that\nthe logic of Beck is not directly applicable to penalty phase\nproceedings. In California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992 (1983),\nwe rejected an argument that Beck prohibited an instruc\ntion to “a capital sentencing jury regarding the Governor’s\npower to commute a sentence of life without possibility of\nparole.” 463 U.S., at 994, 1006–1009. In so doing, we\nnoted the “fundamental difference between the nature of\nthe guilt/innocence determination at issue in Beck and the\nnature of the life/death choice at the penalty phase.” Id.,\nat 1007. In light of that critical distinction, we observed\nthat “the concern of Beck regarding the risk of an unwar\nranted conviction is simply not directly translatable to the\ndeliberative process in which the capital jury engages in\ndetermining the appropriate penalty.” Id., at 1009; see\nalso Schad, supra, at 647 (stating that the “central con\ncern of Beck simply is not implicated” when the “jury was\nnot faced with an all-or-nothing choice between the offense\nof conviction (capital murder) and innocence”).\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n   The jurors in Mitts’s case could not have plausibly\nthought that if they declined to recommend the death\npenalty Mitts would “escape all penalties for his alleged\nparticipation in the crime.” Beck, supra, at 629. They had\njust convicted him on two counts of aggravated murder\nand two counts of attempted murder. They were specifi\ncally instructed that if they did not find that the aggravat\ning factors outweighed the mitigating factors—and there\nfore did not recommend the death penalty—they would\nchoose from two life sentence options. There is accord\ningly no reason to believe that the jurors in this case,\nunlike the jurors in Beck, could have been improperly\ninfluenced by a fear that a decision short of death would\nhave resulted in Mitts walking free.\n   We all but decided the question presented here in\nSpisak itself. After rejecting the contention that the Ohio\ninstructions were contrary to Mills, we noted that “the\nCourt of Appeals found the jury instructions unconstitu\ntional for an additional reason, that the instructions ‘re\nquire[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence\nbefore considering other sentencing alternatives.’ ” 558\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Spisak v. Mitchell, 465\nF.3d 684, 709 (CA6 2006)). That is essentially the Beck\nclaim presented here. See 620 F.3d, at 658 (holding that\na “jury instruction violates due process if it requires a\nmandatory death penalty sentence that can only be\navoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity\nto consider life imprisonment”). We rejected that claim in\nSpisak under AEDPA, noting that “[w]e have not . . .\npreviously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this\nreason.” 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Although neither\nthe parties nor the courts below in Spisak had cited Beck,\na separate concurrence in Spisak would have struck down\nthe instructions in reliance on that decision. See 558\nU. S., at ___ (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concur\nring in judgment) (slip op., at 3–6). The Court nonetheless\n6                     BOBBY v. MITTS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nconcluded that whatever the merits of that argument on\ndirect review, “the jury instructions at Spisak’s trial were\nnot contrary to ‘clearly established Federal law’ ” under\nAEDPA.

S. 433. In rejecting his claim a second time, the Court of Appeals held that it did not have to presume the immunity finding's correctness because the state court had not adequately developed the finding. It reasoned that the state court's conclusion amounted to mere personal impression on an issue not subject to significant dispute at trial and stated that the District Court had found that the key witness had not been granted immunity.\nHeld: The Court of Appeals' decision was based on a manifest error. The District Court did not make the immunity finding as claimed by the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals overlooked evidence strongly supporting Burden's contention regarding an immunity deal. On remand, the Court of Appeals or, subject to its further order, the District Court must determine whether counsel's representation created an actual conflict of interest adversely affecting his performance.\nCertiorari granted; 975 F. 2d 771, reversed and remanded.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nIn Burden v. Zant, 498 U. S. 433 (1991) (per curiam), we reversed a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which had upheld denial of habeas relief on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to conflict of interest. The case is before us again on a petition seeking review of the decision rendered on remand, 975 F. 2d 771 (1992), in which the Court of Appeals once again rejected Burden's claim that he had been deprived of the right to be represented by counsel free of conflict of interest.\n\n\n2\nIn our earlier unanimous per curiam opinion, we held that the courts below had failed to accord the presumption of correctness apparently due a state-court determination bearing on the conflict claim (i. e., that Dixon, the key prosecution witness allegedly represented by Burden's pretrial counsel, \"`was granted immunity from prosecution,'\" 498 U. S., at 436). See 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d). We directed the Court of Appeals on remand to evaluate Burden's conflict-of-interest claim \"free from\" the \"erroneous failure to credit the state trial court's finding . . . .\" 498 U. S., at 438.\n\n\n3\nIn the decision now before us, the Eleventh Circuit majority first held that there was no need for a federal habeas court to presume the correctness of the immunity finding, because it had not been \"adequately developed\" in the state trial court proceeding. See 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d)(3). The majority reasoned that the trial court's conclusion, contained in an administrative report to the State Supreme Court, see Ga. Code Ann. § 17-10-35(a) (1990), and not labeled a finding of fact or conclusion of law, amounted to the trial judge's mere personal \"impression\" on an issue not subject to significant dispute at trial. See 975 F. 2d, at 774-775. Declaring it \"improper\" to defer to the judge's \"comment,\" id., at 775, the Court of Appeals explained that it would uphold its prior denial of relief on the basis of a District Court finding, said to be that \"Dixon did not testify under a grant of transactional immunity or pursuant to a promise that the State would not prosecute him,\" ibid. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Anderson maintained that the District Court's order contained no such finding and that his colleagues had overlooked the record of evidence strongly supporting Burden's contention that some sort of immunity deal had, in fact, been struck.\n\n\n4\nReviewing the record, we are convinced that Judge Anderson was correct, that the decision of the Court of Appeals was grounded on manifest mistake, and that reversal is warranted on that basis alone. We therefore grant the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse and remand for the Eleventh Circuit, or subject to its further order the District Court, to determine whether Mr. Kondritzer's representation created \"an actual conflict of interest adversely affect[ing] [his] performance.\" Cuyler v.

DAN WIDEMAN ET AL. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 12–168.   Decided November 5, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  This case concerns the award of attorney’s fees in a suit\nalleging unconstitutional conduct by government officials.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nheld that a plaintiff who secured a permanent injunction\nbut no monetary damages was not a “prevailing party”\nunder 42 U.S. C. §1988, and so could not receive fees.\nThat was error. Because the injunction ordered the de-\nfendant officials to change their behavior in a way that\ndirectly benefited the plaintiff, we vacate the Fourth Cir-\ncuit’s decision and remand for further proceedings.\n                        *     *    *\n  Petitioner Steven Lefemine and members of Columbia\nChristians for Life (CCL) engage in demonstrations in\nwhich they carry pictures of aborted fetuses to protest the\navailability of abortions. On November 3, 2005, Lefemine\nand about 20 other CCL members conducted such a\ndemonstration at a busy intersection in Greenwood Coun-\nty, South Carolina. Citing complaints about the graphic\nsigns, a Greenwood County police officer informed Lefem-\nine that if the signs were not discarded, he would be tick-\neted for breach of the peace. Lefemine objected, asserting\nthat the officer was violating his First Amendment rights,\nbut the threat eventually caused him to disband the pro-\ntest. See Lefemine v. Davis, 732 F. Supp. 2d 614, 617–619\n(SC 2010).\n  A year later, an attorney for Lefemine sent a letter to\n2                  LEFEMINE v. WIDEMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nDan Wideman, the sheriff of Greenwood County, inform-\ning him that the group intended to return to the same site\nwith the disputed signs. The letter cautioned that further\ninterference would cause Lefemine “ ‘to pursue all avail-\nable legal remedies.’ ” Id., at 619. Chief Deputy Mike\nFrederick responded that the police had not previously\nviolated Lefemine’s rights, and warned that “ ‘should we\nobserve any protester or demonstrator committing the\nsame act, we will again conduct ourselves in exactly the\nsame manner: order the person(s) to stop or face criminal\nsanctions.’ ” Ibid. Out of fear of those sanctions, the group\nchose not to protest in the county for the next two years.\nSee ibid.\n   On October 31, 2008, Lefemine filed a complaint under\n42 U.S. C. §1983 against several Greenwood County\npolice officers alleging violations of his First Amendment\nrights. Lefemine sought nominal damages, a declaratory\njudgment, a permanent injunction, and attorney’s fees.\nSee 732 F. Supp. 2d, at 620. Ruling on the parties’ dueling\nmotions for summary judgment, the District Court deter-\nmined that the defendants had infringed Lefemine’s\nrights. See id., at 620–625. The court therefore perma-\nnently enjoined the defendants “from engaging in content-\nbased restrictions on [Lefemine’s] display of graphic signs”\nunder similar circumstances. Id., at 627. The court,\nhowever, refused Lefemine’s request for nominal damages,\nfinding that the defendants were entitled to qualified\nimmunity because the illegality of their conduct was not\nclearly established at the time. See ibid. The court as\nwell denied Lefemine’s request for attorney’s fees under\n§1988, stating that “[u]nder the totality of the facts in this\ncase the award of attorney’s fees is not warranted.” Ibid.\n   The Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of attorney’s fees\non the ground that the District Court’s judgment did\nnot make Lefemine a “prevailing party” under §1988. 672\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                   3\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nF. 3d 292, 302–303 (2012).* The court reasoned that the\nrelief awarded did not “ ‘alte[r] the relative positions of\nthe parties’ ”: The injunction prohibited only “unlawful, but\nnot legitimate, conduct by the defendant[s],” and merely\n“ordered [d]efendants to comply with the law and safe-\nguard [Lefemine’s] constitutional rights in the future. No\nother damages were awarded.” Ibid. Lefemine sought a\nwrit of certiorari to review the Fourth Circuit’s determina-\ntion that he was not a prevailing party under §1988.\n   The Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90\nStat. 2641, 42 U.S. C. §1988, allows “the prevailing party”\nin certain civil rights actions, including suits brought\nunder §1983, to recover “a reasonable attorney’s fee.” A\nplaintiff “prevails,” we have held, “when actual relief on\nthe merits of his claim materially alters the legal relation-\nship between the parties by modifying the defendant’s\nbehavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.”\nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111–112 (1992). And we\nhave repeatedly held that an injunction or declaratory\njudgment, like a damages award, will usually satisfy that\ntest. See, e.g., Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1, 4 (1988) (per\ncuriam).\n   Under these established standards, Lefemine was a\nprevailing party. Lefemine desired to conduct demonstra-\ntions in Greenwood County with signs that the defendant\npolice officers had told him he could not carry. He brought\nthis suit in part to secure an injunction to protect himself\nfrom the defendants’ standing threat of sanctions. And he\nsucceeded in removing that threat. The District Court\nheld that the defendants had violated Lefemine’s rights\nand enjoined them from engaging in similar conduct in the\n\n——————\n  * The defendants did not appeal the District Court’s judgment that\nthey had violated Lefemine’s First Amendment rights, so the Court of\nAppeals took as a given that a violation had occurred. See 672 F. 3d, at\n299, n. 5.\n4                  LEFEMINE v. WIDEMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nfuture. Contrary to the Fourth Circuit’s view, that ruling\nworked the requisite material alteration in the parties’\nrelationship. Before the ruling, the police intended to stop\nLefemine from protesting with his signs; after the ruling,\nthe police could not prevent him from demonstrating\nin that manner. So when the District Court “ordered\n[d]efendants to comply with the law,” 672 F. 3d, at 303,\nthe relief given—as in the usual case involving such an\ninjunction—supported the award of attorney’s fees.\n   Because Lefemine is a “prevailing party,” he “should\nordinarily recover an attorney’s fee unless special circum-\nstances would render such an award unjust.” Hensley v.\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Neither of the courts below addressed\nwhether any special circumstances exist in this case, and\nwe do not do so; whether there may be other grounds on\nwhich the police officers could contest liability for fees\nis not a question before us. Accordingly, the petition for\ncertiorari is granted, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Demos, Jr. has made 48 in forma pauperis filings in this Court since the beginning of the October 1988 Term, many of which challenged sanctions imposed by lower courts for frivolous filings.  Almost two years ago, we prospectively denied Demos leave to proceed in forma pauperis \"in all future petitions for extraordinary relief.\"  In re Demos, 500 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1569, 1570, 114 L.Ed.2d 20 (1991) (per curiam ).  At that time, we said that Demos \"remains free under the present order to file in forma pauperis requests for relief other than an extraordinary writ, if he qualifies under this Court's Rule 39 and does not similarly abuse that privilege.\" Ibid.\n\n\n2\nSince then, Demos has filed 14 petitions for certiorari.  We denied the first seven petitions outright, and denied Demos leave to proceed in forma pauperis under our Rule 39.8 as to the following six.  Today, we invoke Rule 39.8 again with respect to the instant petition.  Demos is allowed until March 29, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit the petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. Because Demos has refused to heed our prior warning, we further direct the Clerk to reject all future petitions for certiorari from Demos in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.  See Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 397, 121 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (per curiam ).

In his petition for certiorari, Trest pointed out that the Fifth Circuit had raised and decided the \"procedural default'' question sua sponte, and that language in the court's opinion suggested that it had thought that, once it had noticed the possibility of a procedural default, it was required to raise the matter on its own.\nHeld: A court of appeals is not \"required'' to raise the issue of procedural default sua sponte. Pp. ___-___.\n(a)  In the habeas context, procedural default is normally a \"defense'' that the State is \"obligated to raise'' and \"preserv[e]'' if it is not to \"lose the right to assert the defense thereafter.'' Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, ----, 116 S.Ct. 2074, 2082, 135 L.Ed.2d 457. This Court is unaware of any precedent stating that a habeas court must raise such a matter where the State itself does not do so.  P. ___.\n(b)  This is not an appropriate case in which to examine whether the law nonetheless permitted the Fifth Circuit to raise the procedural default sua sponte. First, its opinion contains language suggesting it believed that, despite Louisiana's failure to raise the matter, Circuit precedent required, not simply permitted, it to consider a potential procedural default.  Second, Trest made clear in his certiorari petition that he intended to limit the question to mandatory consideration, and Louisiana in its response did not object, suggest alternate wording, or ask this Court to consider the question in any broader context. Third, the broader question cannot be easily answered in the context of this case, for this Court is uncertain about matters which arguably are relevant to the question of whether the law permitted the Fifth Circuit to raise a procedural default sua sponte: questions about the exhaustion of Trest's federal claims in state court and about the relevant procedural rules to be applied.  The parties might have considered these questions, and the Fifth Circuit might have determined their relevance or their answers, had that court not decided the procedural default question without giving the parties an opportunity for argument. Pp. ___-___.\n94 F.3d 1005, vacated and remanded.\nBREYER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nRebecca L. Hudsmith, Washington, DC, for petitioner.\nKathleen E. Petersen, for respondent.\nJustice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe petitioner in this case, Richard Trest, seeks a writ of habeas corpus, which would vacate a long sentence that he is serving in a Louisiana prison for armed robbery.  The District Court refused to issue the writ.  Trest appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which ruled against him on the ground of \"procedural default.'' Trest v. Whitley, 94 F.3d 1005, 1007 (1996).  The Fifth Circuit believed that Trest had failed to raise his federal claims on time in state court, that a state court would now refuse to consider his claims for that reason, and that this state procedural reason amounted to an adequate and independent state ground for denying Trest relief.  Hence, in the absence of special circumstances, a federal habeas court could not reach the merits of Trest's federal claims. Id., at 1007-1009; see generally Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 111 S.Ct.  2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982).\n\n\n2\nIn his petition for certiorari to this Court, Trest pointed out that the Court of Appeals had raised and decided the question of \"procedural default'' sua sponte. The parties themselves had neither raised nor argued the matter.  And language in the Court of Appeals' opinion suggested that the court had thought that, once it had noticed the possibility of a procedural default, it was required to raise the matter on its own.  Trest consequently asked us to decide whether a court of appeals, reviewing a district court's habeas corpus decision, \"is required to raise  . . . sua sponte'' a petitioner's potential procedural default. Pet. for Cert i (emphasis added).  We agreed to do so.\n\n\n3\nPrecedent makes clear that the answer to the question presented is \"no.''  A court of appeals is not \"required'' to raise the issue of procedural default sua sponte. It is not as if the presence of a procedural default deprived the federal court of jurisdiction, for this Court has made clear that in the habeas context, a procedural default, that is, a critical failure to comply with state procedural law, is not a jurisdictional matter. See Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1517, 1522, 137 L.Ed.2d 771 (1997); Coleman, supra, at 730-731, 111 S.Ct., at 2554-2555.  Rather, \" [i]n the habeas context, the application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine,'' of which a procedural default is typically an instance, \"is grounded in concerns of comity and federalism.'' Coleman, supra, at 730, 111 S.Ct., at 2554 (contrasting habeas proceeding with this Court's direct review of a state court judgment).  Thus, procedural default is normally a \"defense'' that the State is \"obligated to raise'' and \"preserv[e]'' if it is not to \"lose the right to assert the defense thereafter.'' Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, ----, 116 S.Ct. 2074, 2082, 135 L.Ed.2d 457 (1996); see Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, 234, n. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 2127, n. 1, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980).  We are not aware of any precedent stating that a habeas court must raise such a matter where the State itself does not do so.  And Louisiana concedes as much, for it says in its brief that \"the Fifth Circuit clearly was not \"required' to sua sponte invoke procedural default.''  Brief for Respondent 16-17.\n\n\n4\nLouisiana, however, would like us to go beyond the question presented and hold that the law permitted (though it did not require) the Fifth Circuit to raise the procedural default sua sponte. Cf. Granberry v. Greer, 481 U.S. 129, 133-134, 107 S.Ct. 1671, 1674-1675, 95 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987) (appellate court may raise sua sponte petitioner's failure to exhaust state remedies).  We recognize some uncertainty in the lower courts as to whether, or just when, a habeas court may consider a procedural default that the State at some point has waived, or failed to raise.  Compare Esslinger v. Davis, 44 F.3d 1515, 1525-1528 (C.A.11 1995) (sua sponte invocation of procedural default serves no important federal interest) with Hardiman v. Reynolds, 971 F.2d 500, 502-505 (C.A.10 1992) (comity and scarce judicial resources may justify court raising state procedural default sua sponte); see also Liebman & Hertz, 2 Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §26.2, 814-817 (1994) (citing cases).  Nonetheless, we  do not believe this is an appropriate case in which to examine that question for several reasons.  First, the Fifth Circuit's opinion contains language suggesting the court believed that, despite Louisiana's failure to raise the matter, Circuit precedent required the court (and did not simply permit the court) to consider a potential procedural default.  See, e.g., 94 F.3d, at 1007 (\" [T]his court's decision in Sones v. Hargett, 61  F.3d 410 (C.A.5 1995) . . .  precludes us from reviewing the merits of Trest's habeas challenge'').\n\n\n5\nSecond, the language of the question presented in Trest's petition for certiorari, as well as the arguments made in his petition, made clear that Trest intended to limit the question in the way we have described.  Yet Louisiana in its response did not object or suggest alternate wording.  Nor did Louisiana ask us to consider the question in any broader context.\n\n\n6\nThird, we cannot now easily answer the broader question in the context of this case, for we are uncertain about matters which arguably are relevant to the question of whether the law permitted the Fifth Circuit to raise a procedural default sua sponte. The parties disagree, for example, about whether or not Trest has fully, or partially, exhausted his current federal claims by raising them in state court.  Cf. Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S., at 518-520, 102 S.Ct., at 1203-1204.  They disagree about whether Louisiana has waived any \"nonexhaustion'' defense.  Cf. Granberry v. Greer, supra. They consequently disagree about whether this is, or is not, the kind of case in which a federal court might rely upon the existence of a state \"procedural bar''  despite the failure of any state court to assert one.  See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S., at 735, n. 1, 111 S.Ct., at 2557, n. 1\n\n\n7\nThe parties also seem to disagree about which state's procedural rules are relevant.  Trest's federal claims focus upon the 35-year sentence of imprisonment that the Louisiana court imposed (under a Louisiana \"habitual offender'' law) in light of his earlier convictions in Mississippi for burglary.  Trest argued that those earlier convictions were constitutionally invalid because they rested upon a guilty plea which he says the Mississippi court accepted without having first told him about his rights to appeal, to trial by jury, to confront witnesses, and not to incriminate himself.  Cf. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S.  238, 242-244, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711-1713, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); State v. Robicheaux, 412 So.2d 1313, 1316-1317 (La.1982).  The Fifth Circuit did not reach the merits of Trest's claims because  it believed that the Mississippi courts would have barred any challenge to his Mississippi convictions as a challenge that, under state law, came too late in the day.  See Miss.Code. Ann. §99-39-5(2).  Trest, and amici supporting him, state that the relevant procedural law (for the purposes of the \"procedural default'' doctrine) is that of Louisiana, rather than that of Mississippi, for it is Louisiana, not Mississippi, which holds Trest in custody.  And it is not clear whether Mississippi's procedural law would create a \"default'' that would bar federal courts from considering whether Louisiana, not Mississippi, could (or could not) use Mississippi convictions to enhance a sentence for a subsequent Louisiana crime.\n\n\n8\nWe note that the parties might have considered these questions, and the Court of Appeals might have determined their relevance or their answers, had that court not decided the procedural default question without giving the parties an opportunity for argument.  We do not say that a court must always ask for further briefing when it disposes of a case on a basis not previously argued.  But often, as here, that somewhat longer  (and often fairer) way \"round is the shortest way home.  Regardless, we have answered the question presented, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we remand the case for  further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n9\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

Youngblood, Jr., on charges including abduction of three young women, Katara, Kimberly, and Wendy, and two instances of sexual assault upon Katara. The cases went to trial in 2003 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, where a jury convicted Youngblood of two counts of sexual assault, two counts of brandishing a firearm, and one count of indecent exposure. The conviction rested principally on the testimony of the three women that they were held captive by Youngblood and a friend of his, statements by Katara that she was forced at gunpoint to perform oral sex on Youngblood, and evidence consistent with a claim by Katara about disposal of certain physical evidence of their sexual encounter. Youngblood was sentenced to a combined term of 26 to 60 years' imprisonment, with 25 to 60 of those years directly attributable to the sexual-assault convictions.\nSeveral months after being sentenced, Youngblood moved to set aside the verdict. He claimed that an investigator working on his case had uncovered new and exculpatory evidence, in the form of a graphically explicit note that both squarely contradicted the State's account of the incidents and directly supported Youngblood's consensual-sex defense. The note, apparently written by Kimberly and Wendy, taunted Youngblood and his friend for having been \"played\" for fools, warned them that the girls had vandalized the house where Youngblood brought them, and mockingly thanked Youngblood for performing oral sex on Katara. The note was said to have been shown to a state trooper investigating the sexual-assault allegations against Youngblood; the trooper allegedly read the note but declined to take possession of it, and told the person who produced it to destroy it. Youngblood argued that the suppression of this evidence violated the State's federal constitutional obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defense, and in support *869 of his argument he referred to cases citing and applying Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\nThe trial court denied Youngblood a new trial, saying that the note provided only impeachment, but not exculpatory, evidence. The trial court did not discuss Brady or its scope, but expressed the view that the investigating trooper had attached no importance to the note, and because he had failed to give it to the prosecutor the State could not now be faulted for failing to share it with Youngblood's counsel. See App. C to Pet. for Cert. (Tr. 22-23 (Sept. 25, 2003)).\nA bare majority of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia affirmed, finding no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, but without examining the specific constitutional claims associated with the alleged suppression of favorable evidence. 217 W. Va. 535, 548, 618 S.E.2d 544, 557 (2005) (per curiam). Justice Davis, dissenting in an opinion that Justice Starcher joined, unambiguously characterized the trooper's instruction to discard the new evidence as a Brady violation. 217 W. Va., at 550-552, 618 S. E. 2d, at 559-561. The dissenters concluded that the note indicating that Youngblood engaged in consensual sex with Katara had been suppressed and was material, id., at 550, n. 6, 618 S.E.2d, at 559, n. 6 (citing Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 435, 437-438 (1995)), both because it was at odds with the testimony provided by the State's three chief witnesses (Katara, Kimberly, and Wendy) and also because it was entirely consistent with Youngblood's defense at trial that his sexual encounters with Katara were consensual, 217 W. Va., at 551-552, 618 S. E. 2d, at 560-561. Youngblood then filed this petition for a writ of certiorari.\nA Brady violation occurs when the government fails to disclose evidence materially favorable to the accused. See 373 U.S., at 87. This Court has held that the Brady duty extends to impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence, United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676 (1985), and Brady suppression occurs when the government fails to turn *870 over even evidence that is \"known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor,\" Kyles, 514 U. S., at 438. See id., at 437 (\"[T]he individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police\"). \"Such evidence is material `if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different,'\" Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280 (1999) (quoting Bagley, supra, at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)), although a \"showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant's acquittal,\" Kyles, 514 U. S., at 434. The reversal of a conviction is required upon a \"showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\" Id., at 435.\nYoungblood clearly presented a federal constitutional Brady claim to the State Supreme Court, see Brief for Appellant in No. 31765 (Sup. Ct. App. W. Va.), pp. 42-47, as he had to the trial court, see App. C to Pet. for Cert. (Tr. 6, 44-45, 50, 51 (Sept. 25, 2003)); id., at 13, 17 (Sept. 29, 2003). And, as noted, the dissenting justices discerned the significance of the issue raised. If this Court is to reach the merits of this case, it would be better to have the benefit of the views of the full Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia on the Brady issue. We, therefore, grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the State Supreme Court, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.\nIn Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U.S. 163 (1996) (per curiam), we greatly expanded our \"no-fault V & R practice\" (GVR) *871 beyond its traditional bounds. Id., at 179 (Scalia, J., dissenting). At the time, I remarked that \"[t]he power to `revise and correct' for error has become a power to void for suspicion\" of error, id., at 190 (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 175 (1803); alterations omitted). And I predicted that \"`GVR'd for clarification of ___'\" would \"become a common form of order, drastically altering the role of this Court.\" 516 U.S., at 185. Today, by vacating the judgment of a state court simply because \"[i]f this Court is to reach the merits of this case, it would be better to have the benefit of the views of the full Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia on the Brady issue,\" ante, at 870, the Court brings this prediction to fulfillment.\nIn Lawrence, I identified three narrow circumstances in which this Court could, consistent with the traditional understanding of our appellate jurisdiction (or at least consistent with entrenched practice), justify vacating a lower court's judgment without first identifying error: \"(1) where an intervening factor has arisen [e. g., new legislation or a recent judgment of this Court] that has a legal bearing upon the decision, (2) where, in a context not governed by Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983), clarification of the opinion below is needed to assure our jurisdiction, and (3) (in acknowledgment of established practice, though not necessarily in agreement with its validity) where the respondent or appellee confesses error in the judgment below.\" 516 U.S., at 191-192 (dissenting opinion). Needless to say, today's novel GVR order falls into none of these categories. There has been no intervening change in law that might bear upon the judgment. Our jurisdiction is not in doubt, see ante, at 870; State v. Frazier, 162 W. Va. 935, 942, n. 5, 253 S.E.2d 534, 538, n. 5 (1979) (petitioner's Brady claim was properly presented in his motion for a new trial). And the State has confessed no errornot even on the broadest and least supportable theory of what constitutes an error justifying vacatur. See, e. g., Alvarado v. United States, 497 U.S. 543, 545 *872 (1990) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (vacating when the Solicitor General confessed error in the lower court's \"`analysis,'\" but not its judgment); Stutson v. United States, 516 U.S. 193 (1996) (per curiam) (vacating when the Solicitor General confessed error in a position taken before the Court of Appeals, on which the court might have relied; discussed in Lawrence, supra, at 184-185 (Scalia, J., dissenting)); Department of Interior v. South Dakota, 519 U.S. 919, 921 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (vacating when \"the Government, having lost below, wishes to try out a new legal position\"). Here, the Court vacates and remands in light of nothing.\nInstead, the Court remarks tersely that it would be \"better\" to have \"the benefit\" of the West Virginia court's views on petitioner's Brady claim, should we eventually decide to take the case. Ante, at 870. The Court thus purports to conscript the judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia to write what is essentially an amicus brief on the merits of an issue they have already decided, in order to facilitate our possible review of the merits at some later time. It is not at all clear why it would be so much \"better\" to have the full court below address the Brady claim. True, we often prefer to review reasoned opinions that facilitate our considerationthough we may review even a summary disposition. See Lawrence, supra, at 186 (Scalia, J., dissenting). But the dissenting judges in the case below discussed petitioner's Brady claim at some length (indeed, at greater length than appears in many of the decisions we agree to review), and argued that it was meritorious. See 217 W. Va. 535, 549-552, 618 S.E.2d 544, 558-561 (2005) (Davis, J., joined by Starcher, J., dissenting). Since we sometimes review judgments with no opinion, and often review judgments with opinion only on one side of the issue, it is not clear why we need opinions on both sides here.\nTo tell the truth, there is only one obvious sense in which it might be \"better\" to have the West Virginia court revisit *873 the Brady issue: If the majority suspects that the court below erred, there is a chance that the GVR-in-light-of-nothing will induce it to change its mind on remand, sparing us the trouble of correcting the suspected error. It is noteworthy that, to justify its GVR order, the Court does not invoke even the flabby standard adopted in Lawrence, namely, whether there is \"a reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity for further consideration,\" 516 U.S., at 167. That is because (there being no relevant intervening event to create such a probability) the only possibility that the West Virginia court will alter its considered judgment is created by this Court's GVR order itself. A case such as this, which meets none of the usual, outcome-neutral criteria for granting certiorari set forth in this Court's Rules 10(a)(c), could attract our notice only if we suspected that the judgment appealed from was in error. Those whose judgments we review have sometimes viewed even our legitimate, intervening-event GVR orders as polite directives that they reverse themselves. See, e. g., Sharpe v. United States, 712 F.2d 65, 67 (CA4 1983) (Russell, J., dissenting) (\"Once again, I think the majority has mistaken gentleness in instruction for indefiniteness in command. The Supreme Court was seeking to be gentle with us but there is, I submit, no mistaking what they expected us to do\"). How much more is that suspicion justified when the GVR order rests on nothing more than our statement that it would be \"better\" for the lower court to reconsider its decision (much as a mob enforcer might suggest that it would be \"better\" to make protection payments).\nEven when we suspect error, we may have many reasons not to grant certiorari outright in a case such as thisan overcrowded docket, a reluctance to correct \"the misapplication of a properly stated rule of law,\" this Court's Rule 10, or (in this particular case) even a neo-Victorian desire to keep the lurid phrases of the \"graphically explicit note,\" *874 ante, at 868, out of the U. S. Reports. But none of these reasons justifies \"a tutelary remand, as to a schoolboy made to do his homework again.\" Lawrence, 516 U. S., at 185-186 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In \"the nature of the appellate system created by the Constitution and laws of the United States,\" id., at 178, state courts and lower federal courts are constitutionally distinct tribunals, independently authorized to decide issues of federal law. They are not, as we treat them today, \"the creatures and agents of this body,\" id., at 178-179. If we suspect that a lower court has erred and wish to correct its error, we should grant certiorari and decide the issue ourselves in accordance with the traditional exercise of our appellate jurisdiction.\nIt is particularly ironic that the Court inaugurates its \"GVR-in-light-of-nothing\" practice by vacating the judgment of a state court. Our no-fault GVR practice had its origins \"in situations calling forth the special deference owed to state law and state courts in our system of federalism.\" Id., at 179. We first used it to allow the state court to decide the effect of an intervening change in state law. Ibid. (citing Missouri ex rel. Wabash R. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 273 U.S. 126 (1927)). Likewise, our other legitimate category of no-fault GVRto ensure our own jurisdiction\"originate[d] in the special needs of federalism.\" Lawrence, 516 U. S., at 181. In vacating the judgment of a state court for no better reason than our own convenience, we not only fail to observe, but positively flout the \"special deference owed to . . . state courts,\" id., at 179. Like the Ouroboros swallowing its tail, our GVR practice has ingested its own original justification.\nChief Justice Marshall wrote in Marbury v. Madison that \"[i]t is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted . . . .\" 1 Cranch, at 175. At best, today's unprecedented decision rests on a finding that the state court's \"opinion, though arguably correct, [is] incomplete and unworkmanlike,\" *875 Lawrence, 516 U. S., at 189 (Scalia, J., dissenting)which all Members of the Court in Lawrence agreed was an illegitimate basis for a GVR, see id., at 173 (per curiam). At worst, it is an implied threat to the lower court, not backed by a judgment of our own, that it had \"better\" reconsider its holding.\nI suppose it would be available to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, on remand, simply to reaffirm its judgment without further elaboration. Or it could instead enter into a full discussion of the Brady issue, producing either a reaffirmance or a revision of its judgment. The latter course will of course encourage and stimulate our new \"GVR-in-light-of-nothing\" jurisprudence. Verb. sap.\nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, dissenting.\nThe Court's order to grant, vacate, and remand (GVR) in Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U.S. 163 (1996) (per curiam), had my assent. In that case there was a new administrative interpretation that the Court of Appeals did not have an opportunity to consider. Id., at 174. The Court today extends the GVR procedure well beyond Lawrence and the traditional practice of issuing a GVR order in light of some new development. See id., at 166-167. Since the issuance of a GVR order simply for further explanation is, as Justice Scalia explains, see ante, p. 870 (dissenting opinion), both improper and contrary to our precedents, I respectfully dissent.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

HEINTZ, et al., Petitioners,v.Darlene JENKINS.\nNo. 94-367.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nArgued Feb. 21, 1995.\nDecided April 18, 1995.\n\n\nSyllabus\n*\n\nPetitioner Heintz is a lawyer representing a bank that sued respondent Jenkins to recover the balance due on her defaulted car loan.  After a letter from Heintz listed the amount Jenkins owed as including the cost of insurance bought by the bank when she reneged on her promise to insure the car, Jenkins brought this suit against Heintz and his law firm under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which forbids \"debt collector[s]\" to make false or misleading representations and to engage in various abusive and unfair practices.  The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that the Act does not apply to lawyers engaging in litigation.  The Court of Appeals disagreed and reversed.\nHeld:  The Act must be read to apply to lawyers engaged in consumer debt-collection litigation for two rather strong reasons. First, a lawyer who regularly tries to obtain payment of consumer debts through legal proceedings meets the Act's definition of \"debt collector\":  one who \"regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, [consumer] debts owed . . . another,\" 15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6).  Second, although an earlier version of that definition expressly excluded \"any attorney-at-law collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of and in the name of a client,\" Congress repealed this exemption in 1986 without creating a narrower, litigation-related, exemption to fill the void. Heintz's arguments for nonetheless inferring the latter type of exemption—(1) that many of the Act's requirements, if applied directly to litigation activities, will create harmfully anomalous results that Congress could not have intended;  (2) that a postenactment statement by one of the 1986 repeal's sponsors demonstrates that, despite the removal of the earlier blanket exemption, the Act still does not apply to lawyers' litigating activities;  and (3) that a nonbinding \"Commentary\" by the Federal Trade Commission's staff establishes that attorneys engaged in sending dunning letters and other traditional debt-collection activities are covered by the Act, while those whose practice is limited to legal activities are not—are unconvincing.  Pp. __.\n25 F.3d 536, affirmed.\nBREYER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nGeorge W. Spellmire, Chicago, IL, for petitioners.\nDaniel A. Edelman, Chicago, IL, for respondent.\nJustice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe issue before us is whether the term \"debt collector\" in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 91 Stat. 874, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692-1692o (1988 ed. and Supp. V), applies to a lawyer who \"regularly,\" through litigation, tries to collect consumer debts. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that it does. We agree with the Seventh Circuit and we affirm its judgment.\n\n\n2\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act prohibits \"debt collector[s]\" from making false or misleading representations and from engaging in various abusive and unfair practices.  The Act says, for example, that a \"debt collector\" may not use violence, obscenity, or repeated annoying phone calls, 15 U.S.C. § 1692d; may not falsely represent \"the character, amount, or legal status of any debt,\" § 1692e(2)(A);  and may not use various \"unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect\" a consumer debt, § 1692f.  Among other things, the Act sets out rules that a debt collector must follow for \"acquiring location information\" about the debtor, § 1692b;  communicating about the debtor (and the debt) with third parties, § 1692c(b);  and bringing \"[l]egal actions,\" § 1692i.  The Act imposes upon \"debt collector[s]\" who violate its provisions (specifically described) \"[c]ivil liability\" to those whom they, e.g., harass, mislead, or treat unfairly.  § 1692k.  The Act also authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to enforce its provisions.  § 1692l (a).  The Act's definition of the term \"debt collector\" includes a person \"who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed [to] . . . another.\"  § 1692a(6).  And, it limits \"debt\" to consumer debt, i.e., debts \"arising out of . . . transaction[s]\" that \"are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\"  § 1692a(5).\n\n\n3\nThe plaintiff in this case, Darlene Jenkins, borrowed money from the Gainer Bank in order to buy a car.  She defaulted on her loan.  The bank's law firm then sued Jenkins in state court to recover the balance due.  As part of an effort to settle the suit, a lawyer with that law firm, George Heintz, wrote to Jenkins.  His letter, in listing the amount she owed under the loan agreement, included $4,173 owed for insurance, bought by the bank because she had not kept the car insured as she had promised to do.\n\n\n4\nJenkins then brought this Fair Debt Collection Practices Act suit against Heintz and his firm.  She claimed that Heintz's letter violated the Act's prohibitions against trying to collect an amount not \"authorized by the agreement creating the debt,\" § 1692f(1), and against making a \"false representation of . . . the . . . amount . . . of any debt,\" § 1692e(2)(A).  The loan agreement, she conceded, required her to keep the car insured \"against loss or damage\" and permitted the bank to buy such insurance to protect the car should she fail to do so.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 17.  But, she said, the $4,137 substitute policy was not the kind of policy the loan agreement had in mind, for it insured the bank not only against \"loss or damage\" but also against her failure to repay the bank's car loan.  Hence, Heintz's \"representation\" about the \"amount\" of her \"debt\" was \"false\"; amounted to an effort to collect an \"amount\" not \"authorized\" by the loan agreement;  and thus violated the Act.\n\n\n5\nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the District Court dismissed Jenkins's Fair Debt Collection lawsuit for failure to state a claim.  The court held the Act does not apply to lawyers engaging in litigation. However, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court's judgment, interpreting the Act to apply to litigating lawyers.  Jenkins v. Heintz, 25 F.3d 536 (1994).  The Seventh Circuit's view in this respect conflicts with that of the Sixth Circuit.  See Green v. Hocking, 9 F.3d 18 (1993) (per curiam).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.  513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 416, 130 L.Ed.2d 332 (1994).  And, as we have said, we conclude that the Seventh Circuit is correct.  The Act does apply to lawyers engaged in litigation.\n\n\n6\nThere are two rather strong reasons for believing that the Act applies to the litigating activities of lawyers.  First, the Act defines the \"debt collector[s]\" to whom it applies as including those who \"regularly collec[t] or attemp[t] to collect, directly or indirectly, [consumer] debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\"  § 1692a(6).  In ordinary English, a lawyer who regularly tries to obtain payment of consumer debts through legal proceedings is a lawyer who regularly \"attempts\" to \"collect\" those consumer debts.  See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 263 (6th ed. 1990) (\"To collect a debt or claim is to obtain payment or liquidation of it, either by personal solicitation or legal proceedings\").\n\n\n7\nSecond, in 1977, Congress enacted an earlier version of this statute, which contained an express exemption for lawyers.  That exemption said that the term \"debt collector\" did not include \"any attorney-at-law collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of and in the name of a client.\"  Pub.L. 95-109, § 803(6)(F), 91 Stat. 874, 875.  In 1986, however, Congress repealed this exemption in its entirety, Pub.L. 99-361, 100 Stat. 768, without creating a narrower, litigation-related, exemption to fill the void.  Without more, then, one would think that Congress intended that lawyers be subject to the Act whenever they meet the general \"debt collector\" definition.\n\n\n8\nHeintz argues that we should nonetheless read the statute as containing an implied exemption for those debt-collecting activities of lawyers that consist of litigating (including, he assumes, settlement efforts).  He relies primarily on three arguments.\n\n\n9\nFirst, Heintz argues that many of the Act's requirements, if applied directly to litigating activities, will create harmfully anomalous results that Congress simply could not have intended. We address this argument in light of the fact that, when Congress first wrote the Act's substantive provisions, it had for the most part exempted litigating attorneys from the Act's coverage;  that, when Congress later repealed the attorney exemption, it did not revisit the wording of these substantive provisions;  and that, for these reasons, some awkwardness is understandable. Particularly when read in this light, we find Heintz's argument unconvincing.\n\n\n10\nMany of Heintz's \"anomalies\" are not particularly anomalous. For example, the Sixth Circuit pointed to § 1692e(5), which forbids a \"debt collector\" to make any \"threat to take action that cannot legally be taken.\"  The court reasoned that, were the Act to apply to litigating activities, this provision automatically would make liable any litigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim against a debtor.  Green, supra, at 21.  But, the Act says explicitly that a \"debt collector\" may not be held liable if he \"shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\"  § 1692k(c).  Thus, even if we were to assume that the suggested reading of § 1692e(5) is correct, we would not find the result so absurd as to warrant implying an exemption for litigating lawyers.  In any event, the assumption would seem unnecessary, for we do not see how the fact that a lawsuit turns out ultimately to be unsuccessful could, by itself, make the bringing of it an \"action that cannot legally be taken.\"\n\n\n11\nThe remaining significant \"anomalies\" similarly depend for their persuasive force upon readings that courts seem unlikely to endorse.  For example, Heintz's strongest \"anomaly\" argument focuses upon the Act's provisions governing \"[c]ommunication in connection with debt collection.\"  § 1692c.  One of those provisions requires a \"debt collector\" not to \"communicate further\" with a consumer who \"notifies\" the \"debt collector\" that he or she \"refuses to pay\" or wishes the debt collector to \"cease further communication.\"  § 1692c(c).  In light of this provision, asks Heintz, how can an attorney file a lawsuit against (and thereby communicate with) a nonconsenting consumer or file a motion for summary judgment against that consumer?\n\n\n12\nWe agree with Heintz that it would be odd if the Act empowered a debt-owing consumer to stop the \"communications\" inherent in an ordinary lawsuit and thereby cause an ordinary debt-collecting lawsuit to grind to a halt.  But, it is not necessary to read § 1692c(c) in that way—if only because that provision has exceptions that permit communications \"to notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor may invoke\" or \"intends to invoke\" a \"specified remedy\" (of a kind \"ordinarily invoked by [the] debt collector or creditor\").  §§ 1692c(c)(2), (3).  Courts can read these exceptions, plausibly, to imply that they authorize the actual invocation of the remedy that the collector \"intends to invoke.\"  The language permits such a reading, for an ordinary court-related document does, in fact, \"notify\" its recipient that the creditor may \"invoke\" a judicial remedy.  Moreover, the interpretation is consistent with the statute's apparent objective of preserving creditors' judicial remedies.  We need not authoritatively interpret the Act's conduct-regulating provisions now, however.  Rather, we rest our conclusions upon the fact that it is easier to read § 1692c(c) as containing some such additional, implicit, exception than to believe that Congress intended, silently and implicitly, to create a far broader exception, for all litigating attorneys, from the Act itself.\n\n\n13\nSecond, Heintz points to a statement of Congressman Frank Annunzio, one of the sponsors of the 1986 amendment that removed from the Act the language creating a blanket exemption for lawyers.  Representative Annunzio stated that, despite the exemption's removal, the Act still would not apply to lawyers' litigating activities.  Representative Annunzio said that the Act\n\n\n14\n\"regulates debt collection, not the practice of law.      Congress repealed the attorney exemption to the act, not      because of attorney[s'] conduct in the courtroom, but because      of their conduct in the backroom.  Only collection      activities, not legal activities, are covered by the act. . .      .  The act applies to attorneys when they are collecting      debts, not when they are performing tasks of a legal nature.      . . .  The act only regulates the conduct of debt collectors,      it does not prevent creditors, through their attorneys, from      pursuing any legal remedies available to them.\"  132      Cong.Rec. 30842 (1986).\n\n\n15\nThis statement, however, does not persuade us.\n\n\n16\nFor one thing, the plain language of the Act itself says nothing about retaining the exemption in respect to litigation. The line the statement seeks to draw between \"legal\" activities and \"debt collection\" activities was not necessarily apparent to those who debated the legislation, for litigating, at first blush, seems simply one way of collecting a debt.  For another thing, when Congress considered the Act, other Congressmen expressed fear that repeal would limit lawyers' \"ability to contact third parties in order to facilitate settlements\" and \"could very easily interfere with a client's right to pursue judicial remedies.\" H.R.Rep. No. 99-405, p. 11 (1985) (dissenting views of Rep. Hiler).  They proposed alternative language designed to keep litigation activities outside the Act's scope, but that language was not enacted.  Ibid.  Further, Congressman Annunzio made his statement not during the legislative process, but after the statute became law.  It therefore is not a statement upon which other legislators might have relied in voting for or against the Act, but it simply represents the views of one informed person on an issue about which others may (or may not) have thought differently.\n\n\n17\nFinally, Heintz points to a \"Commentary\" on the Act by the Federal Trade Commission's staff.  It says:\n\n\n18\n\"Attorneys or law firms that engage in traditional debt      collection activities (sending dunning letters, making      collection calls to consumers) are covered by the [Act], but      those whose practice is limited to legal activities are not      covered.\"  Federal Trade Commission—Statements of General      Policy or Interpretation Staff Commentary on the Fair Debt      Collection Practices Act, 53 Fed.Reg. 50097, 50100 (1988)      (emphasis added;  footnote omitted).\n\n\n19\nWe cannot give conclusive weight to this statement.  The Commentary of which this statement is a part says that it \"is not binding on the Commission or the public.\"  Id., at 50101.  More importantly, we find nothing either in the Act or elsewhere indicating that Congress intended to authorize the FTC to create this exception from the Act's coverage—an exception that, for the reasons we have set forth above, falls outside the range of reasonable interpretations of the Act's express language.  See, e.g., Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 552, 555, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994) (slip op., at ---- - ----);  see also Fox v. Citicorp Credit Servs., Inc., 15 F.3d 1507, 1513 (CA9 1994) (FTC staff's statement conflicts with Act's plain language and is therefore not entitled to deference);  Scott v. Jones, 964 F.2d 314, 317 (CA4 1992) (same).\n\n\n20\nFor these reasons, we agree with the Seventh Circuit that the Act applies to attorneys who \"regularly\" engage in consumer-debt-collection activity, even when that activity consists of litigation.  Its judgment is therefore\n\n\n21\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

Bryson, Bethesda, MD, for petitioner.\nWalter B. Nash, III, Tucson, AZ, appointed by this Court, for respondents.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has adopted what it terms a \"coconspirator exception\" to the rule regarding who may challenge the constitutionality of a search or seizure.  Under its reasoning, a co-conspirator obtains a legitimate expectation of privacy for Fourth Amendment purposes if he has either a supervisory role in the conspiracy or joint control over the place or property involved in the search or seizure.  This \"exception,\" apparently developed in a series of earlier decisions of the Court of Appeals, squarely contradicts the controlling case from this Court.  We therefore reject it.\n\n\n2\nWhile patrolling Interstate Highway 10 in Casa Grande, Arizona, Officer Russel Fifer spotted a Cadillac traveling westbound at approximately 65 miles per hour.  Fifer followed the Cadillac for several miles because he thought the driver acted suspiciously as he passed the patrol car.  Fifer ultimately stopped the Cadillac because it was going too slowly.  Luis Arciniega, the driver and sole occupant of the car, gave Fifer his driver's license and an insurance card demonstrating that respondent Donald Simpson, a United States customs agent, owned the Cadillac.  Fifer and Robert Williamson, an officer who appeared on the scene to assist Fifer, believed that Arciniega matched the drug courier profile.  Acting on this belief, they requested and received Arciniega's permission to search the vehicle.  The officers found 560 pounds of cocaine in the trunk and immediately arrested Arciniega.\n\n\n3\nAfter agreeing to make a controlled delivery of the cocaine, Arciniega made a telephone call to his contact from a motel in Tempe, Arizona.  Respondents Jorge and Maria Padilla drove to the motel in response to the telephone call, but were arrested as they attempted to drive away in the Cadillac.  Like Arciniega, Maria Padilla agreed to cooperate with law enforcement officials.  She led them to the house in which her husband, respondent Xavier Padilla, was staying.  The ensuing investigation linked Donald Simpson and his wife, respondent Maria Sylvia Simpson, to Xavier Padilla.1\n\n\n4\nRespondents were charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of § 841(a)(1).  Xavier Padilla was also charged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 848 (1988 ed. and Supp. III).  Respondents moved to suppress all evidence discovered in the course of the investigation, claiming that the evidence was the fruit of the unlawful investigatory stop of Arciniega's vehicle.  The United States District Court for the District of Arizona ruled that all respondents were entitled to challenge the stop and search because they were involved in \"a joint venture for transportation . . . that had control of the contraband.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a. The District Court reasoned that, as owners, the Simpsons retained a reasonable expectation of privacy in their car, but that the Padillas could contest the stop solely because of their supervisory roles and their \"joint control over a very sophisticated operation. . . .\"  Id., at 23a.  On the merits, the District Court ruled that Officer Fifer lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Arciniega,2 and granted respondents' motion to suppress.\n\n\n5\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.  The court began its analysis by stating that in order \"[t]o contest the legality of a search and seizure, the defendants must establish that they had a 'legitimate expectation of privacy' in the place searched or the property seized.\"  960 F.2d 854, 858-859 (CA9 1992) (quoting Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143-144, 99 S.Ct. 421, 430-431, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978)).  The court then recited its co-conspirator rule:  \"a coconspirator's participation in an operation or arrangement that indicates joint control and supervision of the place searched establishes standing.\"  960 F.2d, at 859 (citations omitted).\n\n\n6\nRelying on a line of cases from the Ninth Circuit, the court held that \"because Xavier Padilla and Donald and Maria Simpson have demonstrated joint control and supervision over the drugs and vehicle and engaged in an active participation in a formalized business arrangement, they have standing to claim a legitimate expectation of privacy in the property searched and the items seized.\"  Id., at 860-861.  Donald Simpson established an expectation of privacy \"not simply because [he] owned the car\" but also because \"he had a coordinating and supervisory role in the operation.  He was a critical player in the transportation scheme who was essential in getting the drugs across the border.\"  Id. at 860.  Maria Simpson established a privacy interest because she \"provided a communication link\" between her husband, Xavier Padilla and other members of the conspiracy, and \"held a supervisory role tying everyone together and overseeing the entire operation.\"  Ibid.  Xavier Padilla established an expectation of privacy because he \"exhibited substantial control and oversight with respect to the purchase [and] the transportation through Arizona.\"  Ibid.  The court expressly stated that it did not matter that Xavier was not present during the stop, or that he could not exclude others from searching the Cadillac.  Ibid.\n\n\n7\nThe Court of Appeals could not tell from the record whether Jorge and Maria Padilla \"shared any responsibility for the enterprise,\" or whether they were \"mere employees in a family operation.\"  Id., at 861.  As a result, the court remanded to the District Court for further findings on that issue.\n\n\n8\nThe Ninth Circuit appears to stand alone in embracing the \"coconspirator exception.\"3  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 404, 121 L.Ed.2d 330 (1992), and now reverse.  It has long been the rule that a defendant can urge the suppression of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment only if that defendant demonstrates that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the challenged search or seizure.  Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 171-172, 89 S.Ct. 961, 965-966, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969);  Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 131, n. 1, 133-134, 99 S.Ct. 421, 425-426, n. 1, 425-426, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978);  Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98, 106, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 2562, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980).  We applied this principle to the case of coconspirators in Alderman, in which we said:\n\n\n9\n\"The established principle is that suppression of the product      of a Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully urged      only by those whose rights were violated by the search      itself, not by those who are aggrieved solely by the      introduction of damaging evidence.  Co-conspirators and      codefendants have been accorded no special standing.\"  394      U.S., at 171-172, 89 S.Ct., at 965-966.\n\n\n10\nIn Rakas, supra, police search of a car yielded a box of rifle shells found in the glove compartment, and a sawed-off rifle found under the passenger seat.  We held that petitioners, who were passengers in the car and had no ownership interest in the rifle shells or sawed-off rifle, and no legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched, had suffered no invasion of their Fourth Amendment rights.  See also Rawlings, supra;  Soldal v. Cook County, Illinois, 506 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 538, 544-545, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992) (decided since the Court of Appeals rendered its decision in the present case).\n\n\n11\nThe \"coconspirator exception\" developed by the Ninth Circuit is, therefore, not only contrary to the holding of Alderman, but at odds with the principle discussed above.  Expectations of privacy and property interests govern the analysis of Fourth Amendment search and seizure claims.  Participants in a criminal conspiracy may have such expectations or interests, but the conspiracy itself neither adds nor detracts from them.  Neither the fact, for example, that Maria Simpson was the \"communication link\" between her husband and the others, nor the fact that Donald Simpson and Xavier Padilla were in charge of transportation for the conspirators, has any bearing on their respective Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n\n12\nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The case is remanded so that the court may consider whether each respondent had either a property interest protected by the Fourth Amendment that was interfered with by the stop of the automobile driven by Arciniega, or a reasonable expectation of privacy that was invaded by the search thereof.  Alderman, supra;  Rakas, supra;  Rawlings, supra;  Soldal, supra.\n\n\n13\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n1\n A related investigation led by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) revealed that Warren Strubbe was also involved in the conspiracy.  Although Strubbe technically is a respondent in this case, see this Court's Rule 12.4, the Court of Appeals found that he could not challenge the stop and search of the Cadillac. Strubbe did not file a petition challenging that decision, and we therefore do not address that aspect of the court's opinion.\n\n\n2\n The Government did not challenge this finding on appeal and does not do so here.\n\n\n3\n The First, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and District of Columbia Circuits have declined to adopt an exception for co-conspirators or codefendants.

In November 1993, they filed suit against petitioners, who are Arkansas state officials, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to Amendment 68 of the Arkansas Constitution, § 1 of which prohibits the use of state funds to pay for any abortion \"except to save the mother's life.\"  Their claim was that this provision is inconsistent with a requirement in Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 343, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., as affected by the 1994 version of the \"Hyde Amendment,\" that States fund medically necessary abortions where the pregnancy resulted from an act of rape or incest.1  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas granted summary judgment for respondents and enjoined Amendment 68;  the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 60 F.3d 497 (1995).  Petitioners sought certiorari with respect to two aspects of the case:  (1) the District Court's holding that \"[u]nder the Hyde Amendment . . . federal law requires Arkansas and other states that participate in the federal Medicaid program to pay for abortions in cases where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, as well as abortions to save the mother's life,\" 860 F.Supp. 609, 612 (1994), and (2) the District Court's enjoining of Amendment 68 \"in its entirety for so long as the State of Arkansas accepts federal funds pursuant to the Medicaid Act,\" id., at 628 (emphasis added).2  We grant certiorari as to the second of these questions.  Accepting (without deciding) that the District Court's interpretation of the Hyde Amendment is correct, we reverse the decision below insofar as it affirms blanket invalidation of Amendment 68.\n\n\n2\nIn a pre-emption case such as this, state law is displaced only \"to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.\" Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 204, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 1722, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983).  See, e.g., Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U.S. 88, 109, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 2388-2389, 120 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992);  Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, 475 U.S. 355, 376, 106 S.Ct. 1103, 1116, 89 L.Ed.2d 364 (1986).  \"[T]he rule [is] that a federal court should not extend its invalidation of a statute further than necessary to dispose of the case before it.\" Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 502, 105 S.Ct. 2794, 2801, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985).\n\nAmendment 68 reads as follows:\n\n3\n\" § 1. Public funding.  No public funds will be used to pay      for any abortion, except to save the mother's life.\n\n\n4\n\" § 2. Public policy.   The policy of Arkansas is to protect      the life of every unborn child from conception until birth,      to the extent permitted by the Federal Constitution.\n\n\n5\n\" § 3. Effect of amendment.  This amendment will not affect      contraceptives or require an appropriation of public funds.\"\n\n\n6\nSection 1 of this provision is affected by the lower courts' interpretation of Title XIX and the 1994 Hyde Amendment only in cases where a Medicaid-eligible woman seeks to abort a pregnancy resulting from an act of rape or incest and the abortion is not necessary to save the woman's life.  Respondents do not claim that any other possible application of § 1 is pre-empted by current federal law.  It is entirely possible, for example, that § 1 would have application to state programs that receive no federal funding.  As the District Court noted, the Arkansas Crime Victims Reparations Act, Ark.Code Ann. § 16-90-701 et seq.  (Supp.1995), established a program which provides compensation and assistance to victims of criminal acts within the State, including compensation for medical expenses, see § 16-90-703(7).  Without the limitation imposed by Amendment 68, the program might have the authority to reimburse crime victims for abortions not necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman.  Assuming the compensation program is entirely state funded, nothing in respondents' challenge to Amendment 68 suggests that the application of § 1 to the program would conflict with any federal statute.  Because Amendment 68 was challenged only insofar as it conflicted with Title XIX, it was improper to enjoin its application to funding that does not involve the Medicaid program.\n\n\n7\nThe District Court's injunction is overbroad in its temporal scope as well.  The Hyde Amendment is not permanent legislation; it was enacted as part of the statute appropriating funds for certain Executive Departments for one fiscal year.  While the versions of the Hyde Amendment applicable to the 1994 and 1995 fiscal years authorized the use of federal funds to pay for an abortion after notice \"that such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother or that the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest,\" the version of the amendment applicable to prior years limited federal funding to those abortions necessary to save the life of the mother.  See, e.g., § 203, Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 1993, 106 Stat. 1811.  Because this history identifies the possibility that a different version of the Hyde Amendment may be enacted in the future, it was improper for the District Court to enjoin enforcement of Amendment 68 \"for so long as the State of Arkansas accepts federal funds pursuant to the Medicaid Act.\" 860 F.Supp., at 628.  See Planned Parenthood Affiliates of Michigan v. Engler, 73 F.3d 634, 641 (C.A.6 1996) (modifying injunction in similar case to \"tak[e] into account the changeable nature of spending bills in general, and the Hyde Amendment in particular, which in some years are very restrictive and in other years are less so\").\n\n\n8\nThe District Court's invalidation of §§ 2 and 3 of the Amendment was based on the proposition that these sections \"have no function independent of\" § 1. 860 F.Supp., at 626.  Even assuming that to be true, once § 1 is left with the substantial application that the Supremacy Clause fully allows, §§ 2 and 3 subsist as well.\n\n\n9\nWe therefore reverse the decision of the Eighth Circuit insofar as it affirms the scope of the injunction, and remand for entry of an order enjoining the enforcement of Amendment 68 only to the extent that the Amendment imposes obligations inconsistent with federal law.\n\n\n10\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n1\n The 1994 Hyde Amendment, so named for its sponsor, Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois, was enacted as § 509 of the Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 1994, 107 Stat. 1082. Section 509 directs that \"[n]one of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be expended for any abortion except when it is made known to the Federal entity or official to which funds are appropriated under this Act that such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother or that the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.\"  107 Stat. 1113.  The provision was reenacted unchanged for fiscal year 1995.  See 108 Stat. 2539.\n\n\n2\n Any uncertainty as to the scope of the District Court's injunction was erased by a subsequent order denying petitioners' motion for stay of judgment.  The order declares that \"Amendment 68 to the Arkansas Constitution directly conflicts with federal law (the 1994 Hyde Amendment) and is, therefore, null, void and of no effect.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert.

NETHERLAND, Wardenv.Lem Davis TUGGLE.No. A-209.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nSept. 14, 1995.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nApplicant asks that we vacate a stay of execution granted Tuggle by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  Because we agree with applicant that the stay was improvidently entered, we grant his application to vacate, provided that the stay shall remain in effect until September 20, 1995, to allow Tuggle's counsel opportunity to seek a further stay in this Court.\n\n\n2\nOn June 29, 1995, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion vacating the District Court's grant of habeas relief, finding all of Tuggle's constitutional claims to be without merit.  Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F.3d 1356.  The court stayed the issuance of its mandate on August 2, however, and granted Tuggle a 30-day stay of execution pending t he filing of a timely petition for certiorari in this Court;  then on August 25 it extended the stay of execution for the full 90 days allowed to file a certiorari petition in this Court.\n\n\n3\nBoth actions of the court were taken by summary order without opinion or discussion.  Nothing indicates that the Court of Appeals even attempted to undertake the three-part inquiry required by our decision in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895-896, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3395-3396, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983).  See also Maggio v. Williams, 464 U.S. 46, 48, 104 S.Ct. 311, 312, 78 L.Ed.2d 43 (1983) (per curiam );  Autry v. Estelle, 464 U.S. 1, 2-3, 104 S.Ct. 20, 21-22, 78 L.Ed.2d 1 (1983) (per curiam ). There is no hint that the court found that \"four Members of th[is] Court would consider the underlying issue sufficiently meritorious for the grant of certiorari\" or that \"a significant possibility of reversal\" existed.  Barefoot, supra, at 895, 103 S.Ct., at 3395. We think the inescapable conclusion is that the Court of Appeals mistakenly believed that a capital defendant as a matter of right was entitled to a stay of execution until he has filed a petition for certiorari in due course.  But this view was rejected in Autry, supra, at 2, 104 S.Ct., at 21, and Maggio, supra, at 48, 104 S.Ct., at 312.\n\n\n4\nAccordingly, the application to vacate the stay of execution is granted.\n\n\n5\nJustice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.\n\n\n6\nBecause there is no support in the record for the conclusion that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion when it granted a stay of execution to enable respondent Tuggle to file a petition for certiorari, I respectfully dissent.  The fact that the respondent has substantial grounds for challenging the constitutionality of his death sentence is demonstrated both by the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus by the District Court and by the 19-page opinion filed by the Court of Appeals.  Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F.3d 1356 (CA4 1995).  Promptly after that opinion was announced, respondent filed a motion for a stay of execution supported by an explanation of why \"the three-part inquiry,\" ante, at __, described in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895-896, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3395-3396, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), warranted that relief.  It is disrespectful to the Court of Appeals to assume that its grant of that motion did not implicitly endorse the reasoning in respondent's moving papers.\n\n\n7\nThe stay of execution would merely have given respondent the opportunity to seek the review in this Court that has been authorized by Congress and our Rules.  In my opinion it is both unwise and unfair to require a death row inmate who has acted diligently at all stages of his litigation to prepare and file a petition raising substantial claims more promptly than other litigants.  I would deny the warden's application.\n\n\n8\nJustice SOUTER would deny the application to vacate stay of execution.\n\n\n9\nJustice BREYER, for reasons stated in the first paragraph of Justice STEVENS' dissent, votes to deny the application.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

WHITAKERv.SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY  (MERRILL REESE, INC., Real Party in Interest).\nNo. 94-7743.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nApril 17, 1995.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPro se petitioner Fred Whitaker has filed a petition for writ of certiorari and requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court.  Pursuant to Rule 39.8, we deny petitioner's request to proceed in forma pauperis.*  Petitioner is allowed until May 8, 1995, to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.  For the reasons explained below, we also direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from petitioner in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner is a prolific filer in this Court.  Since 1987, he has filed 24 petitions for relief, including 6 petitions for extraordinary relief and 18 petitions for certiorari.  Fifteen of the twenty-four petitions have been filed in the last four Terms, and we have denied all 24 petitions without recorded dissent.  We also have denied petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to Rule 39.8 of this Court for the last three petitions in which he has sought extraordinary relief.  See In re Whitaker, 513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 570, 130 L.Ed.2d 488 (1994);  In re Whitaker, 511 U.S. ---, 114 S.Ct. 2098, 128 L.Ed.2d 661 (1994); In re Whitaker, 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 489, 121 L.Ed.2d 428 (1992).  And earlier this Term, we directed the Clerk of the Court \"not to accept any further petitions for extraordinary writs from petitioner in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38(a) and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\"  513 U.S., at ----, 115 S.Ct., at 570.  Though we warned petitioner at that time about his \"frequent filing patterns with respect to petitions for writ of certiorari,\" ibid., we limited our sanction to petitions for extraordinary writs.\n\n\n3\nWe now find it necessary to extend that sanction to petitions for certiorari filed by petitioner.  In what appears to be an attempt to circumvent this Court's prior order, petitioner has labeled his instant petition a \"petition for writ of certiorari\" even though it would seem to be more aptly termed a \"petition for an extraordinary writ\":  he argues that the California Supreme Court erred in denying his petition for review of a California Court of Appeals order which denied his petition for writ of mandate/prohibition seeking to compel a California trial judge to make a particular ruling in a civil action filed by petitioner.  And the legal arguments petitioner makes in his instant \"petition for writ of certiorari\" are, just as those made in his previous 18 petitions for certiorari, frivolous.  As we told petitioner earlier this Term, \"[t]he goal of fairly dispensing justice . . . is compromised when the Court is forced to devote its limited resources to the processing of repetitious and frivolous requests.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n4\nPetitioner's abuse of petitions for certiorari has occurred only in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accordingly. This order therefore will not prevent petitioner from filing a petition for certiorari to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed upon him.  But like other similar orders we have issued, see In re Sassower, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2, 126 L.Ed.2d 6 (1993);  Day v. Day, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 4, 126 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993);  Demos v. Storrie, 507 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1231, 122 L.Ed.2d 636 (1993);  Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 397, 121 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), this order will allow the Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our process.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n6\nJustice STEVENS, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nA simple denial would adequately serve the laudable goal of conserving the Court's \"limited resources.\"  Ante, at ____.  See generally In re Whitaker, 513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 570, 130 L.Ed.2d 488 (1994) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n\n\n8\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n*\n Rule 39.8 provides:  \"If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari, jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary writ, as the case may be, is frivolous or malicious, the Court may deny a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis  \"\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Relying on Circuit precedent holding that the University is \"an arm of the state,'' the District Court concluded that the Eleventh Amendment barred Doe from maintaining his breach-of-contract action in federal court.  In reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that liability for money judgments is the single most important factor in determining whether an entity is an arm of the State, and gave decisive weight to the terms of the University's agreement with the Energy Department, under which the Department, not the State, is liable for any judgment rendered against the University in its performance of the contract.\nHeld: The fact that the Federal Government has agreed to indemnify a state instrumentality against litigation costs, including adverse judgments, does not divest the state agency of  Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Nothing in this Court's opinions supports the notion that the presence or absence of a third party's undertaking to indemnify a state agency should determine  whether it is the kind of entity that should be treated as an arm of the State. Just as with the arm-of-the-State inquiry, see, e.g., Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30, 51-52, 115 S.Ct. 394, _________, 130 L.Ed.2d 245, it is the entity's potential legal liability for judgments, rather than its ability  or inability to require a third party to reimburse it, or to discharge the liability in the first instance, that is relevant in determining the underlying Eleventh Amendment question. Accordingly, the Court rejects Doe's principal contention-that the Amendment does not apply to this litigation because any damages award would be paid by the Energy Department, and therefore have no impact upon California's treasury.  Because the question on which certiorari was granted does not encompass Doe's alternative argument attacking the Ninth Circuit cases holding the University to be an arm of the State, the Court declines to address that argument.  Pp. ___.\n65 F.3d 771, reversed.\nSTEVENS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nCharles A. Miller, for petitioners.\nLisa S. Blatt, Washington, DC, for the United States as amicus curiae by special leave of the Court.\nRichard Gayer, San Francisco, CA, for respondent.\nJustice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe narrow question presented by this case is whether the fact that the Federal Government has agreed to indemnify a state instrumentality against the costs of litigation, including adverse judgments, divests the state agency of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  We hold that it does not.\n\n\n2\n* Respondent, a citizen of New York, brought suit against the Regents of the University of California and several individual defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  Although he alleged other claims, we are concerned only with respondent's breach of contract claim against the University.  Doe contends that the University agreed to employ him as a mathematical physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which the University operates pursuant to a contract with the Federal Government.  According to his complaint, the University wrongfully refused to perform its agreement with Doe because it determined that he could not obtain the required security clearance from the Department of Energy (Department). Relying on Ninth Circuit cases holding that the University is \"an arm of the state,''1 the District Court concluded that the Eleventh Amendment barred respondent from maintaining his breach of contract action in federal court.\n\n\n3\nThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Assuming that in some, but not all, of its functions the University is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity,2 the court addressed the narrow question whether it is an arm of the State when \"acting in a managerial capacity'' for the Livermore Laboratory. Doe v. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 65 F.3d 771, 774 (1995).  Although the majority applied \"a five-factor analysis,''3 it emphasized that \"liability for money judgment is the single most important factor in determining whether an entity is an arm of the state.'' Ibid. The majority opinion gave decisive weight to the terms of the University's agreement with the Department, which made it \"clear that the Department, and not the State of California, is liable for any judgment rendered against the University in its performance of the Contract.'' Ibid.\n\n\n4\nThe dissenting judge did not take issue with the majority's emphasis on the importance of the defendant's liability for a money judgment, but he reasoned that the proper analysis should focus on the primary legal liability rather than the ultimate economic impact of the judgment.  Noting that it was undisputed that a judgment against the University \"is a legal obligation of the State of California,'' id., at 777, he discounted the significance of the indemnitor's secondary, or indirect, liability.  For his conclusion, he relied on Ninth Circuit precedent suggesting that a State may not confer Eleventh Amendment immunity on an entity or individual who would otherwise not enjoy that immunity simply by volunteering to satisfy judgments against the entity, Durning v. Citibank, N. A., 950 F.2d 1419, 1425, n. 3 (1991), or by passing a statute indemnifying individual officers from liability, Blaylock v. Schwinden, 862 F.2d 1352, 1353-1354 (1988). \"The question is not  who pays in the end; it is who is legally obligated to pay the judgment that is being sought.'' 65 F.3d, at 777-778.\n\n\n5\nBecause other Courts of Appeals agree with the dissent's focus on legal rather than financial liability,4 we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.\n\nII\nThe Eleventh Amendment provides:\n\n6\n\"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be      construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced      or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of      another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign      State.''\n\n\n7\nIt has long been settled that the reference to actions \"against one of the United States'' encompasses not only actions in which a State is actually named as the defendant, but also certain actions against state agents and state instrumentalities. Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270, 287, 5 S.Ct. 903, 912, 29 L.Ed. 185 (1885); In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 487, 8 S.Ct. 164, 173, 31 L.Ed. 216 (1887); Smith v. Reeves, 178 U.S. 436, 438-439, 20 S.Ct. 919, 920, 44 L.Ed. 1140 (1900); Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945).  Thus, \"when the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants.'' Id., at 464, 65 S.Ct., at 350.\n\n\n8\nWhen deciding whether a state instrumentality may invoke the State's immunity, our cases have inquired into the relationship between the State and the entity in question.  In making this inquiry, we have sometimes examined \"the essential nature and effect of the proceeding,'' ibid., see also Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327 U.S. 573, 576, 66 S.Ct. 745, 746,  90 L.Ed. 862 (1946), and sometimes focused on the \"nature of the entity created by state law''5 to determine whether it should \"be treated as an arm of the State,'' Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280, 97 S.Ct. 568, 572, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).6\n\n\n9\nOf course, the question whether a money judgment against a state instrumentality or official would be enforceable against the State is of considerable importance to any evaluation of the relationship between the State and the entity or individual being sued. Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U.S. 30, 45-51, 115 S.Ct. 394, ___, 130 L.Ed.2d 245 (1994); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1355-1356, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974); Ford Motor, 323 U.S., at 464, 65 S.Ct., at 350-351.  In Hess, we evaluated the relationship between an entity created by a bistate compact and the States that had joined to create that entity in order to determine whether that entity could properly be denominated as an \"arm'' of either of its founding States for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.   In addition to considering the position of the bistate entity as  a unique creature within the federal system, id., at 39-42, 115 S.Ct., at ___, and the nature of the claims at issue in the underlying proceeding, id., at 42, 115 S.Ct., at ___, we focused particular attention on the fact that \"both legally and practically'' neither of the relevant States would have been obligated to pay a judgment obtained against the bistate entity. Id., at 51-52, 115 S.Ct., at ___.\n\n\n10\nThe respondents seek to detach the importance of a State's legal liability for judgments against a state agency from its moorings as an indicator of the relationship between the State and its creation and to convert the inquiry into a formalistic question of ultimate financial liability.  But none of the reasoning in our opinions lends support to the notion that the presence or absence of a third party's undertaking to indemnify the agency should determine whether it is the kind of entity that should be treated as an arm of the State.\n\n\n11\nJust as with the arm-of-the-state inquiry, we agree with the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals that with respect to the underlying Eleventh Amendment question, it is the entity's potential legal liability, rather than its ability or inability to require a third party to reimburse it, or to discharge the liability in the first instance, that is relevant.  Surely, if the sovereign State of California should buy insurance to protect itself against potential tort liability to pedestrians stumbling on the steps of the State Capitol, it would not cease to be \"one of the United States.''\n\n\n12\nAccordingly, we reject respondent's principal contention-that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to this litigation because any award of damages would be paid by the Department of Energy, and therefore have no impact upon the treasury of the State of California.  The Eleventh Amendment protects the State from the risk of adverse judgments even though the State may be indemnified by a third party.\n\nIII\n\n13\nAs an alternative ground for affirmance, respondent invites us to reexamine the validity of the Ninth Circuit cases holding that the University is an arm of the State.  He argues that we should look beyond the potential impact of an adverse judgment on the state treasury, and examine the extent to which the elected state government exercises \"real, immediate control and oversight'' over the University, see Hess, 513 U.S., at 62, 115 S.Ct., at 411 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), as well as the character of the function that gave rise to the litigation.  Because the question we granted certiorari to address does not encompass this argument, we decline to address it.\n\n\n14\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n15\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.  See United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.\n\n\n1\n See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-22, A-24 and A-28 (citing Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1442-1443 (1989), and Jackson v. Hayakawa, 682 F.2d 1344, 1350 (1982)).\n\n\n2\n The court relied on one case holding that Congress had abrogated the University's immunity from suit for patent infringement, Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 998 F.2d 931, 940-941 (C.A.Fed.1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1140, 114 S.Ct. 1126, 127 L.Ed.2d 434 (1994), and another holding that the University had waived its immunity in some cases, In re Holoholo, 512 F.Supp. 889, 901-902 (D.Haw.1981), for its conclusion that the \"University is an enormous entity which functions in various capacities and which is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity for all of its functions.'' Doe v. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 65 F.3d 771, 775 (1995).  We have no occasion to consider questions of waiver or abrogation of immunity in this case.  Nor is it necessary to decide whether there may be some state instrumentalities that qualify as \"arms of the State'' for some purposes but not others.\n\n\n3\n The five factors considered by the court in evaluating whether the University is an arm of the State were: \" [1] whether a money judgment would be satisfied out of state funds, [2] whether the entity performs central governmental functions, [3] whether the entity may sue or be sued, [4] whether the entity has power to take property in its own name or only the name of the state, and [5] the corporate status of the entity.'' 65 F.3d, at 774.\n\n\n4\n See Cronen v. Texas Dept. of Human Services, 977 F.2d 934, 938 (C.A.5 1992) (\" [T]he source of the damages is irrelevant when the suit is against the state itself or a state agency''); Cannon v. University of Health Sciences/The Chicago Medical School, 710 F.2d 351, 357 (C.A.7 1983) (\"No authority supports Cannon's argument that [the Eleventh Amendment] analysis is altered by the possibility that a damage award would be met through insurance proceeds or from federal funds'').\n\n\n5\n Ultimately, of course, the question whether a particular state agency has the same kind of independent status as a county or is instead an arm of the State, and therefore \"one of the United States'' within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, is a question of federal law.  But that federal question can be answered only after considering the provisions of state law that define the agency's character.\n\n\n6\n We relied in Mt. Healthy on our earlier decision that a California county is not an \"arm of the State'' and therefore may be considered a \"citizen'' of California for the purpose of determining the federal court's diversity jurisdiction over a state law claim. Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 717-721, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 1799-1802, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973).  In Moor we made a \"detailed examination of the relevant provisions of California law'' defining counties, noting that the county \"is liable for all judgments against it and is authorized to levy taxes to pay such judgments,'' that it is \"empowered to issue general obligation bonds,'' and that it has other characteristics that provide \"persuasive indicia of the independent status occupied by California counties relative to the State of California.''

The Court of Appeals assumed, and the parties do not  dispute, that the results were inadmissible under state law both for substantive purposes as well as for impeachment.  The decision below is a misapplication of our Brady jurisprudence, see Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and we accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n2\n* On August 1, 1981, respondent Dwayne Bartholomew robbed a laundromat in Tacoma, Washington.  In the course of the robbery, the laundromat attendant was shot and killed.  Two shots were fired:  one hit the attendant in the head, the second lodged in a counter near the victim's body.  From the beginning, respondent admitted that he committed the robbery and that the shots came from his gun.\n\n\n3\nThe only issue at trial was whether respondent was guilty of aggravated first-degree murder, which requires proof of premeditation;  or of first-degree (felony) murder, which does not.  Respondent's defense was that the gun, a single action revolver (one that must be cocked manually before each shot), discharged by accident—twice.\n\n\n4\nIn addition to the physical evidence concerning the operation of the gun, the prosecution's evidence consisted of the testimony of respondent's brother, Rodney Bartholomew, and of Rodney's girlfriend, Tracy Dormady.  Both Rodney and Tracy testified that on the day of the crime they had gone to the laundromat in question to do their laundry, and that respondent was sitting in his car in the parking lot when they arrived.  While waiting for their laundry, Rodney sat with his brother in the car.  Rodney testified that respondent told him that he intended to rob the laundromat and \"leave no witnesses.\"  According to their testimony, Rodney and Tracy left the laundromat soon after the conversation and went to Tracy's house. Respondent arrived at the house a short time later, and when Tracy asked respondent if he had killed the attendant respondent said \"he had put two bullets in the kid's head.\"  Tracy also testified that she had heard respondent say that he intended to leave no witnesses.  Both Rodney and Tracy's testimony was consistent with their pretrial statements to the police.  State v. Bartholomew, 98 Wash.2d 173, 176-178, 654 P.2d 1170, 1173-1174 (1982).\n\n\n5\nRespondent testified in his own defense.  He admitted threatening the victim with his gun and forcing him to lie down on the floor.  Respondent said, however, that while he was removing money from the cash drawer his gun accidently fired, discharging a bullet into the victim's head.  Respondent further claimed that the gun went off a second time while he was running away. Respondent denied telling Rodney or Tracy that he intended to leave no witnesses.  According to his testimony, moreover, Rodney had assisted in the robbery by convincing the attendant to open the laundromat's door after it had closed for the night, although Rodney left before the crime was committed.  Ibid.  In closing argument the defense sought to discredit Rodney and Tracy's testimony by suggesting that they were lying about the extent of Rodney's participation in the crime.  34 F.3d 870, 872 (CA9 1994).\n\n\n6\nAt the sentencing phase of the trial (respondent was sentenced to death but his sentence was overturned on appeal and he was resentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole), the prosecution's first witness was respondent's cellmate, Stanley Bell.  Bell testified that respondent told him that he made the victim lie on the floor, asked him his age, found out it was 17, replied \"[t]oo bad,\" and shot him.  See State v. Bartholomew, supra, at 178, 654 P.2d, at 1174.\n\n\n7\nBefore trial, the prosecution requested that Rodney and Tracy submit to polygraph examinations.  The answers of both witnesses to the questions asked by the polygraph examiner were consistent with their testimony at trial.  As part of the polygraph examination, the examiner asked Tracy whether she had helped respondent commit the robbery and whether she had ever handled the murder we apon.  Tracy answered in the negative to both questions. The results of the testing as to these questions were inconclusive, but the examiner noted his personal opinion that her responses were truthful.  The examiner also asked Rodney whether he had assisted his brother in the robbery and whether at any time he and his brother were in the laundromat together.  Rodney responded in the negative to both questions, and the examiner concluded that the responses to the questions indicated deception. Neither examination was disclosed to the defense.\n\n\n8\nAfter exhausting his state remedies, respondent filed a habeas action in the District Court for the Western District of Washington, raising, inter alia, a Brady claim based on the prosecution's failure to produce the polygraph examinations.  The District Court denied the writ, concluding that respondent \"fails . . . to show that evidence was withheld.  The information withheld only possibly could have led to some admissible evidence. He fails to show that disclosure of the results of the polygraph to defense counsel would have had a reasonable likelihood of affecting the verdict.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. B5 (emphasis in original).\n\n\n9\nOn appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed.  34 F.3d 870 (1994). The Court of Appeals noted that under Washington law polygraphic examinations are inadmissible in evidence, even for impeachment purposes.  See id., at 875 (citing State v. Ellison, 36 Wash.App. 564, 676 P.2d 531 (1984)).  The court nevertheless reversed the District Court's denial of the writ, concluding that although the results would have been inadmissible at trial, the information was material under Brady.  The Court reasoned that \"[h]ad [respondent's] counsel known of the polygraph results, he would have had a stronger reason to pursue an investigation of Rodney's story;\" that he \"likely would have taken Rodney's deposition\" and that in that deposition \"might well have succeeded in obtaining an admission that he was lying about his participation in the crime\" and \"would likely have uncovered a variety of conflicting statements which could have been used quite effectively in cross-examination at trial.\"  34 F.3d, at 875-876.\n\nII\n\n10\nIf the prosecution's initial denial that polygraph examinations of the two witnesses existed were an intentional misstatement, we would not hesitate to condemn that misrepresentation in the strongest terms.  But as we reiterated just last Term, evidence is \"material\" under Brady, and the failure to disclose it justifies setting aside a conviction, only where there exists a \"reasonable probability\" that had the evidence been disclosed the result at trial would have been different.  Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1565-66, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995);  United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383-84, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.);  id., at 685, 105 S.Ct., at 3385 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  To begin with, on the Court of Appeals' own assumption, the polygraph results were inadmissible under state law, even for impeachment purposes, absent a stipulation by the parties, see 34 F.3d, at 875 (citing State v. Ellison, supra), and the parties do not contend otherwise.  The information at issue here, then—the results of a polygraph examination of one of the witnesses—is not \"evidence\" at all.  Disclosure of the polygraph results, then, could have had no direct effect on the outcome of trial, because respondent could have made no mention of them either during argument or while questioning witnesses.  To get around this problem, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the information, had it been disclosed to the defense, might have led respondent's counsel to conduct additional discovery that might have led to some additional evidence that could have been utilized.  See 34 F.3d, at 875. Other than expressing a belief that in a deposition Rodney might have confessed to his involvement in the initial stages of the crime—a confession that itself would have been in no way inconsistent with respondent's guilt—the Court of Appeals did not specify what particular evidence it had in mind.  Its judgment is based on mere speculation, in violation of the standards we have established.\n\n\n11\nAt trial, respondent's strategy was to discredit Rodney's damaging testimony by suggesting that Rodney was lying in order to downplay his own involvement in the crime.  Id., at 872.  That strategy did not involve deposing Rodney.  It is difficult to see, then, on what basis the Ninth Circuit concluded that respondent's counsel would have prepared in a different manner, or (more important) would have discovered some unspecified additional evidence, merely by disclosure of polygraph results that, as to two questions, were consistent with respondent's pre-established defense.\n\n\n12\nIn speculating that the undisclosed polygraph results might have affected trial counsel's preparation, and hence the result at trial, the Ninth Circuit disagreed with, or disregarded, the view of respondent's own trial counsel.  At the evidentiary hearing held in the Federal District Court in this habeas action, respondent's habeas counsel questioned trial counsel on the importance of the polygraph results:\n\n\n13\n\"Q: And you indicated that your cross-examination of Rodney      was, I think, somewhat limited because of concern that —\n\n\n14\n\"A: It was limited in my own respect.  Nobody tried to limit      me.  In my opinion, as a trial lawyer, that was a very      dangerous witness to me, and I wanted to get as much as I      could out of him without recalling the crystal words again.      Leave no prisoners.\n\n\n15\n\"Q: Do you think it would have been any help to you in doing      that, if you had known of specific questions regarding the      offense on which Mr. Rodney Bartholomew had failed a      polygraph examination?  Would that have perhaps affected the      shape of your cross-examination of him?\n\n\n16\n\"A: I think in retrospect they're almost parallel.  The      questions that he failed were his contribution or implication      in the offense, the holdup, with Mr. Dwayne Bartholomew.  I      believe they were in gloves, so in retrospect they wouldn't      have affected it.  I would have liked to have known it, Mr.      Ford, but I don't think it would have affected the outcome of      the case.\"  Tr. 55-56.\n\n\n17\nTrial counsel's strategic decision to limit his questioning of Rodney undermines the suggestion by the Court of Appeals that counsel might have chosen to depose Rodney had the polygraph results been disclosed.  But of even greater importance was counsel's candid acknowledgement that disclosure would not have affected the scope of his cross-examination.  That assessment is borne out by the best possible proof:  the Federal District Court below went so far as to permit respondent's habeas counsel, armed with the information about the polygraph examinations, to question Rodney under oath.  Even though respondent's counsel was permitted to refer to the polygraph results themselves—reference to which would not be permissible on retrial—counsel obtained no contradictions or admissions out of Rodney.  See id., at 84-87.\n\n\n18\nIn short, it is not \"reasonably likely\" that disclosure of the polygraph results—inadmissible under state law —would have resulted in a different outcome at trial.  Even without Rodney's testimony, the case against respondent was overwhelming.  To acquit of aggravated murder, the jury would have had to believe that respondent's single action revolver discharged accidently, not once but twice, by tragic coincidence depositing a bullet to the back of the victim's head, execution-style, as the victim lay face down on the floor.  In the face of this physical evidence, as well as Rodney and Tracy's testimony—to say nothing of the testimony by Bell that the State likely could introduce on retrial it should take more than supposition on the weak premises offered by respondent to undermine a court's confidence in the outcome.\n\n\n19\nWhenever a federal court grants habeas relief to a state prisoner the issuance of the writ exacts great costs to the State's legitimate interest in finality.  And where, as here, retrial would occur 13 years later, those costs and burdens are compounded many times.  Those costs may be justified where serious doubts about the reliability of a trial infested with constitutional error exist.  But where, as in this case, a federal appellate court, second-guessing a convict's own trial counsel, grants habeas relief on the basis of little more than speculation with slight support, the proper delicate balance between the federal courts and the States is upset to a degree that requires correction.\n\n\n20\n*   *   *\n\n\n21\nThe petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  The respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.\n\n\n22\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n23\nJustice STEVENS, Justice SOUTER, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER dissent from summary disposition of this case.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

At the end of the contracting period, petitioner Arizona Department of Revenue (Department) issued a tax deficiency assessment against Blaze for its failure to pay Arizona's transaction privilege tax on the proceeds from its contracts with the Bureau; that tax is levied on the gross receipts of companies doing business in the State. Blaze protested the assessment and prevailed in administrative proceedings, but the Arizona Tax Court granted the Department summary judgment. The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the Department's argument that United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720, controlled, and holding that federal law pre-empted the tax's application to Blaze.\nHeld:  A State generally may impose a nondiscriminatory tax upon a private company's proceeds from contracts with the Federal Government, regardless of whether the federal contractor renders its services on an Indian reservation. In New Mexico, supra, the Court announced a clear rule that tax immunity is appropriate only when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on its agency or closely connected instrumentality. Id., at 733. To expand that immunity beyond these narrow constitutional limits, Congress must expressly so provide. Id., at 737. Thus, absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption, federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona's transaction privilege tax. The incidence of the tax falls on Blaze, not the Government; nor has Congress exempted these contracts from taxation. Nevertheless, the Arizona Court of Appeals employed a balancing test weighing state, federal, and tribal interests, and held that a congressional intent to pre-empt the tax could be inferred from federal laws regulating Indian welfare. In cases involving taxation of on-reservation activity, this Court has undertaken such a particularized examination where the tax's legal incidence fell on a nontribal entity engaged in a transaction with tribes or tribal members. See, e.g., Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163. But the Court has never employed this balancing test where a State seeks to tax a transaction between the Government and a non-Indian private contractor, and declines to do so now. The need to avoid litigation and to ensure efficient tax administration counsels in favor of a bright-line standard for taxing federal contracts, regardless of whether the contracted-for activity takes place on Indian reservations. Moreover, the political process is uniquely adapted to accommodating the interests implicated by state taxation of federal contractors. New Mexico, supra, at 738. The decision whether to exempt Blaze from the tax rests with Arizona and Congress, not this Court.

New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720 (1982), we held that a State generally may impose a nondiscriminatory tax upon a private company's proceeds from contracts with the Federal Government. This case asks us to determine whether that same rule applies when the federal contractor renders its services on an Indian reservation. We hold that it does.\n\n\n7\n* Under the Federal Lands Highways Program, 23 U.S.C. § 204 the Federal Government finances road construction and improvement projects on federal public roads, including Indian reservation roads. Various federal agencies oversee the planning of particular projects and the allocation of funding to them. §§202(d), 204. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs has the responsibility to \"plan, survey, design and construct\" Indian reservation roads. 25 CFR § 170.3 (1998).\n\n\n8\nOver a several-year period, the Bureau of Indian Affairs contracted with Blaze Construction Company to build, repair, and improve roads on the Navajo, Hopi, Fort Apache, Colorado River, Tohono O'Odham, and San Carlos Apache Indian Reservations in Arizona. Blaze is incorporated under the laws of the Blackfeet Tribe of Montana and is owned by a member of that Tribe. But, as the company concedes, Blaze is the equivalent of a non-Indian for purposes of this case because none of its work occurred on the Blackfeet Reservation. Brief in Opposition 2, n. 1; see Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 160 161 (1980).\n\n\n9\nAt the end of the contracting period, the Arizona Department of Revenue (Department) issued a tax deficiency assessment against Blaze for its failure to pay Arizona's transaction privilege tax on the proceeds from its contracts with the Bureau; that tax is levied on the gross receipts of companies doing business in the State.1 See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§42 1306, 42 1310.16 (1991). Blaze protested the assessment and prevailed at the end of administrative proceedings, but, on review, the Arizona Tax Court granted summary judgment in the Department's favor. The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed. 190 Ariz. 262, 947 P.2d 836 (1997). It rejected the Department's argument that our decision in New Mexico, supra, controlled the case and held that federal law pre-empted the application of Arizona's transaction privilege tax to Blaze. The Arizona Supreme Court denied the Department's petition for review, with one justice voting to grant the petition. We granted certiorari, 523 U.S. ___ (1998), and now reverse.\n\nII\n\n10\nIn New Mexico, we considered whether a State could impose gross receipts and use taxes on the property, income, and purchases of private federal contractors. To remedy \"the confusing nature of our precedents\" in this area, 455 U.S., at 733, we announced a clear rule:\n\n\n11\n\"[T]ax immunity is appropriate in only one circumstance: when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned.\" Id., at 735.\n\n\n12\nWe reasoned that this \"narrow approach\" to the scope of governmental tax immunity \"accord[ed] with competing constitutional imperatives, by giving full range to each sovereign's taxing authority.\" Id., at 735 736 (citing Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466, 483 (1939)). For that immunity to be expanded beyond these \"narrow constitutional limits,\" we explained that Congress must \"take responsibility for the decision, by so expressly providing as respects contracts in a particular form, or contracts under particular programs.\" 455 U.S., at 737 (emphasis added); see also Carson v. Roane-Anderson Co., 342 U.S. 232, 234 (1952). Applying those principles, we upheld each of the taxes at issue in that case because the legal incidence of the taxes fell on the contractors, not the Federal Government; the contractors could not be considered agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government; and Congress had not expressly exempted the contractors' activities from taxation but, rather, had expressly repealed a pre-existing statutory exemption. See New Mexico, 455 U.S., at 743 744.\n\n\n13\nThese principles control the resolution of this case. Absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption, federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona's transaction privilege tax. See id., at 737; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134, 161 (1937). The incidence of Arizona's transaction privilege tax falls on Blaze, not the Federal Government. Blaze does not argue that it is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government, and New Mexico's clear rule would have foreclosed any such argument under these circumstances. Nor has Congress exempted these contracts from taxation. Cf. Carson, supra, at 234.\n\n\n14\nNevertheless, the Arizona Court of Appeals held (and Blaze urges here) that the tax cannot be applied to activities taking place on Indian reservations.2 After it employed a balancing test \"weighing the respective state, federal, and tribal interests,\" Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 177 (1989), the court below held that a congressional intent to pre-empt Arizona's tax could be inferred from federal laws regulating the welfare of Indians. In cases involving taxation of on-reservation activity, we have undertaken this \"particularized examination,\" Ramah Navajo School Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue of N. M., 458 U.S. 832, 838 (1982), where the legal incidence of the tax fell on a nontribal entity engaged in a transaction with tribes or tribal members. See, e.g., Cotton Petroleum Corp., supra, at 176 187 (state severance tax imposed on non-Indian lessee's production of oil and gas); Ramah, supra, at 836 846 (state gross receipts tax imposed on private contractor's proceeds from contract with tribe for school construction); Central Machinery Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 448 U.S. 160, 165 166 (1980) (tax imposed on sale of farm machinery to tribe); White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 144 153 (1980) (motor carrier license and use fuel taxes imposed on logging and hauling operations pursuant to contract with tribal enterprise). But we have never employed this balancing test in a case such as this one where a State seeks to tax a transaction between the Federal Government and its non-Indian private contractor.\n\n\n15\nWe decline to do so now. Interest balancing in this setting would only cloud the clear rule established by our decision in New Mexico. The need to avoid litigation and to ensure efficient tax administration counsels in favor of a bright-line standard for taxation of federal contracts, regardless of whether the contracted-for activity takes place on Indian reservations. Cf. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.S. 450, 458 459 (1995); County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U.S. 251, 267 268 (1992).3 Moreover, as we recognized in New Mexico, the \"political process is 'uniquely adapted to accommodating' \" the interests implicated by state taxation of federal contractors. 455 U.S., at 738 (quoting Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U.S. 444, 456 (1978) (plurality opinion)). Accord, Washington v. United States, 460 U.S. 536, 546 (1983). Whether to exempt Blaze from Arizona's transaction privilege tax is not our decision to make; that deci- sion rests, instead, with the State of Arizona and with Congress.\n\n\n16\nOur conclusion in no way limits the Tribes' ample opportunity to advance their interests when they choose to do so. Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 88 Stat. 2203, 25 U.S.C. § 450 et seq., (1994 ed. and Supp. III), a tribe may request the Secretary of Interior to enter into a self-determination contract \"to plan, conduct, and administer programs or portions thereof, including construction programs.\" §450f(a)(1). Where a tribe enters into such a contract, it assumes greater responsibility over the management of the federal funds and the operation of certain federal programs. See, e.g., 25 CFR § 900.3(b)(4) (1998). Here, the Tribes on whose reservations Blaze's work was performed have not exercised this option, and the Federal Government has retained contracting responsibility. Because the Tribes in this case have not assumed this responsibility, we have no occasion to consider whether the Indian preemption doctrine would apply when Tribes choose to take a more direct and active role in administering the federal funds. Therefore, we see no need to depart from the clear rule announced in New Mexico.\n\n\n17\n* * *\n\n\n18\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n19\nIt is so ordered.\n\nNotes\n\n20\n1.  The Department initially also sought to tax Blaze's proceeds from contracts with tribal housing authorities but eventually dropped its claim. We therefore have no occasion to consider Blaze's tax liability with respect to those contracts.\n\n\n21\n2.  Blaze also appears to argue that Arizona's tax infringes on the Tribes' right to make their own decisions and be governed by them and that this is sufficient, by itself, to preclude application of Arizona's tax. See Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 220 (1959). Our decisions upholding state taxes in a variety of on-reservation settings squarely foreclose that argument. See, e.g., Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 156 (1980); Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U.S. 463, 483 (1976).\n\n\n22\n3.  Indeed, a recent decision by the New Mexico Supreme Court illustrates the perils of a more fact-intensive inquiry. See Blaze Constr. Co., Inc. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept. of New Mexico, 118 N. M. 647, 884 P.2d 803 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1016 (1995). In that case, also involving the imposition of a tax on the gross receipts of Blaze's federal contracts, the New Mexico Supreme Court applied the balancing test in Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163 (1989) and reached the exact opposite conclusion from the Arizona Court of Appeals. 118 N. M., at 652 653, 884 P.2d, at 808 809.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

The District Court granted habeas relief, concluding that the state  court had denied Moore his right to self-representation under Faretta v.  California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975).  The District Court thus vacated the  judgment of conviction and ordered the warden, petitioner here, to  \"release  Moore from custody after the expiration of 60 days unless,  within 60 days hereof, the State of California grants Moore the right to  a new trial.\"  App. A to Brief in Opposition A65.\n\n\n2\nThe State filed a notice of appeal and sought a stay of the District Court's order pending appeal, but its various stay applications  were respectively denied by the District Court, the Ninth Circuit, 56 F.  3d 39 (1995), and by Justice O'Connor, in her capacity as Circuit  Justice for the Ninth Circuit.  The State accordingly set Moore for  retrial, and simultaneously pursued its appeal of the District Court's  order on the merits to the Ninth Circuit.  The Court of Appeals,  observing that the  \"State of California has granted petitioner Charles  Edward Moore, Jr., a new trial,\" dismissed the State's appeal as moot.   App. A. to Pet. for Cert.\n\n\n3\nIt is true, of course, that mootness can arise at any stage of  litigation, Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 459, n. 10 (1974); that  federal courts may not \"give opinions upon moot questions or abstract  propositions,\" Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653 (1895); and that an  appeal should therefore be dismissed as moot when, by virtue of an  intervening event, a court of appeals cannot grant \"any effectual relief  whatever\" in favor of the appellant.  Ibid.  The available remedy,  however, does not need to be \"fully satisfactory\" to avoid mootness.  Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9, 13 (1992).  To the contrary, even the availability of a \"partial remedy,\" is  \"sufficient to prevent [a] case from being moot.\" Ibid.\n\n\n4\nIn this case, to say the least, a \"partial remedy\" necessary to  avoid mootness will be available to the State of California (represented  here by petitioner).  While the administrative machinery necessary for a  new trial has been set in motion, that trial has not yet even begun, let  alone reached a point where the court could no longer award any relief  in the State's favor. Because a decision in the State's favor would  release it from the burden of the new trial itself, the Court of Appeals  is not prevented from granting \"any effectual relief whatever\" in the State's favor, Mills, supra, at 653, and the case is clearly not moot.  We therefore grant the respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis,  grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, reverse the judgment of the  Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent  with this opinion.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

It presents, in addition, some risks unique to leafletting.  And of course, as with solicitation, these risks must be evaluated against a backdrop of the substantial congestion problem facing the Port Authority and with an eye to the cumulative impact that will result if all groups are permitted terminal access.  Viewed in this light, I conclude that the distribution ban, no less than the solicitation ban, is reasonable.  I therefore dissent from the Court's holding striking the distribution ban.\n\n\n5\nI will not trouble to repeat in detail all that has been stated in No. 91-155, International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2701, --- L.Ed.2d ----, describing the risks and burdens flowing to travelers and the Port Authority from permitting solicitation in airport terminals.  Suffice it to say that the risks and burdens posed by leafletting are quite similar to those posed by solicitation.  The weary, harried, or hurried traveler may have no less desire and need to avoid the delays generated by having literature foisted upon him than he does to avoid delays from a financial solicitation.  And while a busy passenger perhaps may succeed in fending off a leafletter with minimal disruption to himself by agreeing simply to take the proffered material, this does not completely ameliorate the dangers of congestion flowing from such leafletting.  Others may choose not simply to accept the material but also to stop and engage the leafletter in debate, obstructing those who follow.  Moreover, those who accept material may often simply drop it on the floor once out of the leafletter's range, creating an eyesore, a safety hazard, and additional clean-up work for airport staff.  See City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 816-817, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2134-2135, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984) (aesthetic interests may provide basis for restricting speech);  Sloane Supplemental Affidavit ¶ 10, App. 514 (noting increased maintenance problems that result from solicitation and distribution).\n\n\n6\nIn addition, a differential ban that permits leafletting but prohibits solicitation, while giving the impression of permitting the Port Authority at least half of what it seeks, may in fact prove for the Port Authority to be a much more Pyrrhic victory. Under the regime that is today sustained, the Port Authority is obliged to permit leafletting.  But monitoring leafletting activity in order to ensure that it is only leafletting that occurs, and not also soliciting, may prove little less burdensome than the monitoring that would be required if solicitation were permitted.  At a minimum, therefore, I think it remains open whether at some future date the Port Authority may be able to reimpose a complete ban, having developed evidence that enforcement of a differential ban is overly burdensome.  Until now it has had no reason or means to do this, since it is only today that such a requirement has been announced.\n\n\n7\nFor the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons stated in the opinion in No. 91-155, 112 S.Ct. 2701, I respectfully dissent.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Although the ensuing settlement in Price stipulated that the Henson action be dismissed with prejudice, the Louisiana state court allowed Henson to proceed. Petitioners removed Henson to the Middle District of Louisiana, relying upon the general removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a), and asserting federal jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, § 1651, and the supplemental jurisdiction statute, § 1367. The case was transferred to the Southern District of Alabama, which, inter alia, dismissed Henson as barred by the Price settlement. As relevant here, the Eleventh Circuit vacated, reasoning that § 1441 by its terms authorizes removal only of actions over which the district courts have original jurisdiction, and that, because the All Writs Act authorizes writs in aid of the courts' respective jurisdictions without providing any federal subject-matter jurisdiction in its own right, that Act could not support Henson's removal from state to federal court.\nHeld: The All Writs Act does not furnish removal jurisdiction. That Act, alone or in combination with the existence of ancillary enforcement jurisdiction, is not a substitute for § 1441's requirement that a federal court have original jurisdiction over an action in order for it to be removed from a state court. Pp. 31-34.\n(a) The All Writs Act—which provides, in § 1651(a), that \"courts established by . . . Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions\"—does not authorize removal of the Henson action. In arguing that the Act supports removal, respondent relies upon United States v. New York Telephone Co., 434 U.S. 159, 172, and Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U.S. 34, 41. The latter case, however, made clear that \"[w]here a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\" Id., at 43. Removal is entirely a creature of statute and \"a suit commenced in a state court must remain there until cause is shown for its transfer under some act of Congress.\" Great Northern R. Co. v. Alexander, 246 U.S. 276, 280. Petitioners may not, by resorting to the All Writs Act, avoid complying with statutory requirements for removal. See Pennsylvania Bureau, supra, at 43. Section 1441(a) provides that \"any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed.\" Under those plain terms, in order properly to remove the Henson action, petitioners must demonstrate that original subject-matter jurisdiction lies in federal courts. Because the All Writs Act does not confer jurisdiction on the federal courts, however, it cannot confer the original jurisdiction required to support removal under § 1441. Pp. 31-33.\n(b) Nor does the All Writs Act authorize the removal of Henson when considered in conjunction with the doctrine of ancillary enforcement jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction \"may extend to claims having a factual and logical dependence on `the primary lawsuit.'\" Peacock v. Thomas, 516 U.S. 349, 355. Because a court must have jurisdiction over a case or controversy before it may assert jurisdiction over ancillary claims, ibid., however, ancillary jurisdiction cannot provide the original jurisdiction that petitioners must show to qualify for § 1441 removal. Invoking ancillary jurisdiction, like invoking the All Writs Act, does not dispense with the need to comply with statutory requirements. Pp. 33-34.\n261 F.3d 1065, affirmed.\nREHNQUIST, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. STEVENS, J., filed a concurring opinion, post, p. 35.\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT.\nHenry B. Alsobrook, Jr., argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Mark C. Surprenant, Robert N. Markle, and Alan B. Nadel.\nDavid J. Bederman argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.*\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nRespondent Hurley Henson filed suit in state court in Iberville Parish, Louisiana, against petitioner Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. (then known as Ciba-Geigy Corp.) asserting various tort claims related to petitioners' manufacture and sale of a chlordimeform-based insecticide. A similar action, Price v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., was already underway in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. The Louisiana court stayed respondent's action when respondent successfully intervened in the Price suit and participated in the ensuing settlement. That settlement included a stipulation that the Henson action, \"including any and all claims . . . against [petitioners], shall be dismissed, with prejudice,\" as of the approval date. App. 38a; see also id., at 36a.\n\n\n2\nFollowing the approval of the settlement, the Louisiana state court conducted a hearing to determine whether the Henson action should be dismissed. Counsel for respondent told the court that the Price settlement required dismissal of only some of the claims raised in Henson. Although this representation appeared to be contrary to the terms of the settlement agreement, the Louisiana court relied upon it and invited respondent to amend the complaint and proceed with the action.\n\n\n3\nCounsel for petitioners did not attend the hearing. Upon learning of the state court's action, however, petitioners promptly removed the action to the Middle District of Louisiana, relying on 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). The notice of removal asserted federal jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, § 1651, and under the supplemental jurisdiction statute, § 1367. The Middle District of Louisiana granted a transfer to the Southern District of Alabama pursuant to § 1404(a), and the Alabama court then dismissed Henson as barred by the Price settlement and sanctioned respondent's counsel for his misrepresentation to the Louisiana state court.\n\n\n4\nThe Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the sanctions but vacated the District Court's order dismissing the Henson action. Henson v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 261 F.3d 1065 (2001). The court reasoned that § 1441 by its terms authorizes removal only of actions over which the district courts have original jurisdiction. But the All Writs Act authorizes writs \"in aid of [the courts'] respective jurisdictions\" without providing any federal subject-matter jurisdiction in its own right, see, e.g., Clinton v. Goldsmith, 526 U.S. 529, 534-535 (1999). Therefore, the Court of Appeals concluded, the All Writs Act could not support removal of the Henson action from state to federal court.\n\n\n5\nIn so holding, the Court of Appeals recognized that several Circuits have held that the All Writs Act gives a federal court the authority to remove a state-court case in order to prevent the frustration of orders the federal court has previously issued. See, e.g., Xiong v. Minnesota, 195 F.3d 424, 426 (CA8 1999); Bylinski v. Allen Park, 169 F.3d 1001, 1003 (CA6 1999); In re Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation, 996 F.2d 1425, 1431 (CA2 1993). It noted, however, that other Circuits have agreed with its conclusion that the All Writs Act does not furnish removal jurisdiction. See, e.g., Hillman v. Webley, 115 F.3d 1461, 1469 (CA10 1997). We granted certiorari to resolve this controversy, 534 U.S. 1126 (2001), and now affirm.\n\n\n6\nThe All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), provides that \"[t]he Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\" Petitioners advance two arguments in support of their claim that removal of the Henson action was proper under the All Writs Act: (1) The All Writs Act authorized removal of the Henson action, and (2) the All Writs Act in conjunction with the doctrine of ancillary enforcement jurisdiction authorized the removal. We address these contentions in turn.\n\n\n7\nFirst, petitioners, like the courts that have endorsed \"All Writs removal,\" rely upon our statement in United States v. New York Telephone Co., 434 U.S. 159, 172 (1977), that the Act authorizes a federal court \"to issue such commands . . . as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the frustration of orders it has previously issued in its exercise of jurisdiction otherwise obtained.\" Petitioners also cite Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U.S. 34, 41 (1985), for the proposition that the All Writs Act \"fill[s] the interstices of federal judicial power when those gaps threate[n] to thwart the otherwise proper exercise of federal courts' jurisdiction.\" They argue that the Act comes into play here because maintenance of the Henson action in state court in Louisiana frustrated the express terms of the Price settlement, which required that \"any and all claims\" in Henson be dismissed.\n\n\n8\nBut Pennsylvania Bureau made clear that \"[w]here a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\" 474 U.S., at 43. The right of removal is entirely a creature of statute and \"a suit commenced in a state court must remain there until cause is shown for its transfer under some act of Congress.\" Great Northern R. Co. v. Alexander, 246 U.S. 276, 280 (1918) (citing Gold-Washing and Water Co. v. Keyes, 96 U.S. 199, 201 (1878)). These statutory procedures for removal are to be strictly construed. See, e.g., Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.S. 100, 108-109 (1941) (noting that policy underlying removal statutes \"is one calling for the strict construction of such legislation\"); Healy v. Ratta, 292 U.S. 263, 270 (1934) (\"Due regard for the rightful independence of state governments . . . requires that [federal courts] scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which the statute has defined\"); Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U.S. 521, 525 (1932); Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260 U.S. 226, 233-234 (1922). Petitioners may not, by resorting to the All Writs Act, avoid complying with the statutory requirements for removal. See Pennsylvania Bureau, supra, at 43 (All Writs Act \"does not authorize [federal courts] to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate\").\n\n\n9\nPetitioners' question presented to this Court suggests a variation on this first argument, asking whether the All Writs Act \"vests federal district courts with authority to exercise removal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1441.\" Pet. for Cert. i (emphasis added). The general removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1441, provides that \"any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending,\" unless Congress specifically provides otherwise. § 1441(a). Under the plain terms of § 1441(a), in order properly to remove the Henson action pursuant to that provision, petitioners must demonstrate that original subject-matter jurisdiction lies in the federal courts. They concede that the All Writs Act \"does not, by its specific terms, provide federal courts with an independent grant of jurisdiction.\" Brief for Petitioners 9; see also Clinton, supra, at 534-535 (express terms of the All Writs Act confine a court \"to issuing process `in aid of' its existing statutory jurisdiction; the Act does not enlarge that jurisdiction\"). Because the All Writs Act does not confer jurisdiction on the federal courts, it cannot confer the original jurisdiction required to support removal pursuant to § 1441.\n\n\n10\nSecond, petitioners contend that some combination of the All Writs Act and the doctrine of ancillary enforcement jurisdiction support the removal of the Henson action. As we explained in Peacock v. Thomas, 516 U.S. 349, 355 (1996), \"[a]ncillary jurisdiction may extend to claims having a factual and logical dependence on `the primary lawsuit.'\" Petitioners emphasize that the Southern District of Alabama retained jurisdiction over the Price settlement, thus distinguishing Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375 (1994), in which we found ancillary jurisdiction lacking. They argue that respondent's maintenance of the Henson action undermined the Price settlement and that, in light of the Alabama court's retained jurisdiction, ancillary enforcement jurisdiction was necessary and appropriate.* But they fail to explain how the Alabama District Court's retention of jurisdiction over the Price settlement authorized removal of the Henson action. Removal is governed by statute, and invocation of ancillary jurisdiction, like invocation of the All Writs Act, does not dispense with the need for compliance with statutory requirements.\n\n\n11\nRead in light of the question presented in the petition for certiorari, perhaps petitioners' argument is that ancillary jurisdiction authorizes removal under 28 U.S.C. § 1441. As we explained in Peacock, however, a \"court must have jurisdiction over a case or controversy before it may assert jurisdiction over ancillary claims.\" 516 U.S., at 355. Ancillary jurisdiction, therefore, cannot provide the original jurisdiction that petitioners must show in order to qualify for removal under § 1441.\n\n\n12\nSection 1441 requires that a federal court have original jurisdiction over an action in order for it to be removed from a state court. The All Writs Act, alone or in combination with the existence of ancillary jurisdiction in a federal court, is not a substitute for that requirement. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n\n13\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Robert N. Weiner and Jonathan Harrison filed a brief for the Product Liability Advisory Council, Inc., as amicus curiae urging reversal.\nBriefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the State of Texas by John Cornyn, Attorney General of Texas, Lonny S. Hoffman, and Gregory S. Coleman; for the Association of Trial Lawyers of America by Jeffrey Robert White; and for Trial Lawyers for Public Justice by Adam Samaha, Roberta B. Walburn, Martha K. Wivell, and Arthur H. Bryant.\n\n\n*\n Petitioners' assertion that removal was \"necessary\" is unpersuasive on its own bottom. One in petitioners' position may apply to the court that approved a settlement for an injunction requiring dismissal of a rival action. Petitioners could also have sought a determination from the Louisiana state court that respondent's action was barred by the judgment of the Alabama District Court\nJUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.\nAs the Court acknowledges, ante, at 32, the decisions of the Courts of Appeals that we disapprove today have relied in large part on our decision in United States v. New York Telephone Co., 434 U.S. 159 (1977).* For the reasons stated in Part II of my dissenting opinion in that case—reasons that are echoed in the Court's opinion today—I believe that it clearly misconstrued the All Writs Act. Id., at 186-190 (opinion dissenting in part). See also id., at 178 (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Because the overly expansive interpretation given to the All Writs Act in New York Telephone may produce further mischief, I would expressly overrule that misguided decision.\nWith these observations, I join the Court's opinion.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n See,e.g., In re VMS Securities Litigation, 103 F.3d 1317, 1323 (CA7 1996); Sable v. General Motors Corp., 90 F.3d 171, 175 (CA6 1996); In re Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation, 996 F.2d 1425, 1431 (CA2 1993). See also Hoffman, Removal Jurisdiction and the All Writs Act, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 401, 417 (1999) (noting that nearly all courts that have approved removal pursuant to the All Writs Act have relied on New York Telephone).\nIndeed, the court below observed that the most powerful argument in favor of petitioners' position is provided by the \"broad view of the All Writs Act's purpose\" articulated in New York Telephone. Henson v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 261 F.3d 1065, 1070 (CA11 2001).\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

The Colorado Supreme Court granted the injunction, holding that \"judicially-created districts are just as binding and permanent as districts created by the General Assembly,\" and that the court-drawn plan must remain in effect until the next decennial census. People ex rel. Salazar v. Davidson, 79 P.3d 1221, 1231 (2003) (en banc), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1093, 124 S. Ct. 2228, 159 L. Ed. 2d 260 (2004). The court further held that this result did not offend the Elections Clause of the United States Constitution. 79 P.3d, at 1232.\nImmediately after Salazar was decided, four Colorado citizensnone of whom had participated in Salazarfiled the instant action in Federal District Court. They argued that Article V, § 44, of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted by the Colorado Supreme Court, violates their rights under the Elections Clause.\nThe District Court initially determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the suit in light of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, but we vacated and remanded for further proceedings. Lance v. Dennis, 546 U.S. 459, 126 S. Ct. 1198, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1059 (2006) (per curiam). On remand, the District Court held that the citizen-plaintiffs had standing to bring their Elections Clause challenge. Lance v. Dennis, 444 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1154-1155 (2006). The court went on, however, to hold that the suit was barred by issue preclusion because the plaintiffs \"stand in privity with the Secretary of State and the General Assembly,\" who were on the losing side in the Salazar litigation. 444 F.Supp.2d, at 1161. The concurring judge concluded that appellants lacked standing to sue in the first place. Id., at 1162 (Porfilio, J., concurring in result). Plaintiffs appeal once again.\nFederal courts must determine that they have jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits. Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94-95, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998).[*] Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" One component of the case-or-controversy requirement is standing, which requires a plaintiff to demonstrate the now-familiar elements of injury in fact, causation, and redressability. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). \"We have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about governmentclaiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at largedoes not state an Article III case or controversy.\" Id., at 573-574, 112 S. Ct. 2130. See also DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. ___, ___, 126 S. Ct. 1854, 1862, 164 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2006) (refusing to create an exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer standing for challenges to state tax or spending decisions, and observing *1197 that taxpayer standing has been rejected \"because the alleged injury is not `concrete and particularized,' but instead a grievance the taxpayer `suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally'\" (citation omitted)).\nOur refusal to serve as a forum for generalized grievances has a lengthy pedigree. In Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U.S. 126, 42 S. Ct. 274, 66 L. Ed. 499 (1922), for example, a citizen sued the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to challenge the procedures by which the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. We dismissed the suit because it was \"not a case within the meaning of ... Article III.\" Id., at 129, 42 S. Ct. 274. The plaintiff sought to assert \"only the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the Government be administered according to law and that the public moneys be not wasted.\" Ibid. \"Obviously,\" we held, \"this general right does not entitle a private citizen to institute [a suit] in the federal courts.\" Id., at 129-130, 42 S. Ct. 274.\nSimilarly, in Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633, 58 S. Ct. 1, 82 L. Ed. 493 (1937) (per curiam), we dismissed a citizen suit claiming that Justice Black's appointment to this Court contravened the Constitution's Ineligibility Clause, Art. I, § 6, cl. 2. We found that the petitioner had no interest in the suit \"other than that of a citizen and a member of the bar of this Court.\" 302 U.S., at 634, 58 S. Ct. 1. That was not enough. To have standing, we observed, a plaintiff must have more than \"a general interest common to all members of the public.\" Ibid. See also Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S. Ct. 597, 67 L. Ed. 1078 (1923) (taxpayer standing cannot be predicated upon an injury the plaintiff \"suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally\"). Cf. Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration, 179 U.S. 405, 406, 21 S. Ct. 206, 45 L. Ed. 252 (1900) (\"[E]ven in a proceeding which he prosecutes for the benefit of the public ... [the plaintiff] must generally aver an injury peculiar to himself, as distinguished from the great body of his fellow citizens\").\nA pair of more recent cases further illustrates the point. In United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 94 S. Ct. 2940, 41 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1974), a federal taxpayer challenged the Government's failure to disclose certain CIA expenditures as a violation of the Constitution's Accounts Clause, which requires that \"a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\" Art. I, § 9, cl. 7. Relying on Levitt, this Court dismissed the claim as a \"generalized grievance\" that is \"plainly undifferentiated and `common to all members of the public.'\" Richardson, 418 U.S., at 176-177, 94 S. Ct. 2940. See also id., at 191, 94 S. Ct. 2940 (Powell, J., concurring) (\"The power recognized in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803), is a potent one. Its prudent use seems to me incompatible with unlimited notions of taxpayer and citizen standing\").\nThe same day, in Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 94 S. Ct. 2925, 41 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1974), we addressed standing to bring a challenge under the Constitution's Incompatibility Clause, which provides that \"no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.\" Art. I, § 6, cl. 2. Citizen-taxpayers brought a lawsuit contending that Members of Congress who were also members of the military Reserves violated the Incompatibility Clause. This Court dismissed for lack of standing. It \"reaffirm[ed] Levitt in holding that standing to sue may not be predicated upon an interest of the kind alleged *1198 here which is held in common by all members of the public, because of the necessarily abstract nature of the injury all citizens share.\" 418 U.S., at 220, 94 S. Ct. 2925. Refusing to entertain generalized grievances ensures that \"there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review\" in a particular case, and it helps guarantee that courts fashion remedies \"no broader than required by the precise facts to which the court's ruling would be applied.\" Id., at 221-222, 94 S. Ct. 2925. In short, it ensures that courts exercise power that is judicial in nature.\nThe instant case parallels Fairchild, Levitt, and their progeny. The plaintiffs here are four Colorado voters. Three days after the Colorado Supreme Court issued its decision in Salazar, they filed a complaint alleging that \"Article V, § 44 of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted in Salazar, violated [the Elections Clause] of the U.S. Constitution by depriving the state legislature of its responsibility to draw congressional districts.\" Lance v. Davidson, 379 F. Supp. 2d 1117, 1122 (2005). In light of the discussion above, the problem with this allegation should be obvious: The only injury plaintiffs allege is that the lawspecifically the Elections Clausehas not been followed. This injury is precisely the kind of undifferentiated, generalized grievance about the conduct of government that we have refused to countenance in the past. It is quite different from the sorts of injuries alleged by plaintiffs in voting rights cases where we have found standing. See, e.g., Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 207-208, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962). Because plaintiffs assert no particularized stake in the litigation, we hold that they lack standing to bring their Elections Clause claim.\nOur two decisions construing the term \"Legislature\" in the Elections Clause do not contradict this holding. Each of these cases was filed by a relator on behalf of the State rather than private citizens acting on their own behalf, as is the case here. See State ex rel. Smiley v. Holm, 184 Minn. 647, 238 N.W. 792 (1931) (per curiam), rev'd sub nom. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 52 S. Ct. 397, 76 L. Ed. 795 (1932); Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U.S. 565, 36 S. Ct. 708, 60 L. Ed. 1172 (1916). In neither case did we address whether a private citizen had alleged a \"concrete and particularized\" injury sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III.\nThe judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is therefore vacated in part, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the Elections Clause claim for lack of standing. We affirm the District Court's dismissal of the Petition Clause claim.\nIt is so ordered.\nNOTES\n[*]  Our prior decision in this case did not violate this principle because Rooker-Feldman concerns a district court's subject-matter jurisdiction, Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 291, 125 S. Ct. 1517, 161 L. Ed. 2d 454 (2005), and \"there is no unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy,\" Ruhrgas AG v.

JAMES KULBICKI\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF \n\n                APPEALS OF MARYLAND\n\n              No. 14–848.   Decided October 5, 2015\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   A criminal defendant “shall enjoy the right . . . to have\nthe Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” U. S. Const.,\nAmdt. 6. We have held that this right requires effective\ncounsel in both state and federal prosecutions, even if the\ndefendant is unable to afford counsel. Gideon v. Wain-\nwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963). Counsel is unconstitu-\ntionally ineffective if his performance is both deficient,\nmeaning his errors are “so serious” that he no longer\nfunctions as “counsel,” and prejudicial, meaning his errors\ndeprive the defendant of a fair trial. Strickland v. Wash-\nington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). Applying this standard\nin name only, the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that\nJames Kulbicki’s defense attorneys were unconstitution-\nally ineffective. We summarily reverse.\n   In 1993, Kulbicki shot his 22-year-old mistress in the\nhead at pointblank range. The two had been ensnarled in\na paternity suit, and the killing occurred the weekend\nbefore a scheduled hearing about unpaid child support. At\nKulbicki’s trial, commencing in 1995, Agent Ernest Peele\nof the FBI testified as the State’s expert on Comparative\nBullet Lead Analysis, or CBLA. In testimony of the sort\nCBLA experts had provided for decades, Peele testified\nthat the composition of elements in the molten lead of a\nbullet fragment found in Kulbicki’s truck matched the\ncomposition of lead in a bullet fragment removed from the\nvictim’s brain; a similarity of the sort one would “ ‘expect’ ”\nif “ ‘examining two pieces of the same bullet.’ ” 440 Md. 33,\n41, 99 A.3d 730, 735 (2014). He further testified that a\n2                 MARYLAND v. KULBICKI\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nbullet taken from Kulbicki’s gun was not an “exac[t]”\nmatch to the bullet fragments, but was similar enough\nthat the two bullets likely came from the same package.\nId., at 42–44, 99 A. 3d, at 735–736. After considering this\nballistics evidence, additional physical evidence from Kul-\nbicki’s truck, and witness testimony, the jury convicted Kul-\nbicki of first-degree murder.\n   Kulbicki then filed a petition for postconviction relief,\nwhich lingered in state court until 2006 when Kulbicki\nadded a claim that his defense attorneys were ineffective\nfor failing to question the legitimacy of CBLA. By then, 11\nyears after his conviction, CBLA had fallen out of favor.\nIndeed, Kulbicki supplemented his petition once more in\n2006 after the Court of Appeals of Maryland held for the\nfirst time that CBLA evidence was not generally accepted\nby the scientific community and was therefore inadmissi-\nble. See Clemons v. State, 392 Md. 339, 371, 896 A.2d\n1059, 1078 (2006).\n   Kulbicki lost in the lower state courts and appealed to\nthe Court of Appeals of Maryland. At that point, Kulbicki\nabandoned his claim of ineffective assistance with respect\nto the CBLA evidence, but the high court vacated\nKulbicki’s conviction on that ground alone. Kulbicki’s coun-\nsel, according to the court, should have found a report\ncoauthored by Agent Peele in 1991 that “presaged the\nflaws in CBLA evidence.” 440 Md., at 40, 99 A. 3d, at 734.\nOne of the many findings of the report was that the com-\nposition of lead in some bullets was the same as that of\nlead in other bullets packaged many months later in a\nseparate box. Rather than conduct “further research to\nexplain the existence of overlapping compositions,” the\nauthors “speculated” that coincidence (or, in one case, the\nlikelihood that separately packaged bullets originated\nfrom the same source of lead) caused the overlap. Id., at\n49, 99 A. 3d, at 739. The Court of Appeals opined that this\nlone finding should have caused the report’s authors to\n                 Cite as: 577 U. S. ____ (2015)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ndoubt “that bullets produced from different sources of lead\nwould have a unique chemical composition,” the faulty\nassumption that ultimately led the court to reject CBLA\nevidence 15 years later. Ibid.; see Clemons, supra, 369–\n370, 896 A.2d, at 1077. The authors’ “failure to fully\nexplore the variance,” the Court of Appeals concluded, was\n“at odds with the scientific method.” 440 Md., at 50, 99\nA. 3d, at 740.\n   In the Court of Appeals’ view, any good attorney should\nhave spotted this methodological flaw. The court held that\ncounsel’s failure to unearth the report, to identify one of\nits findings as “at odds with the scientific method,” and to\nuse this methodological flaw to cast doubt on CBLA during\ncounsel’s cross-examination of Peele, “fell short of prevail-\ning professional norms.” Id., at 50–53, 99 A. 3d, at 740–\n742. Concluding that counsel’s supposed deficiency was\nprejudicial, the court set aside the conviction and ordered\na new trial. Id., at 56, 99 A. 3d, at 743–744.\n   We reverse. The Court of Appeals offered no support for\nits conclusion that Kulbicki’s defense attorneys were\nconstitutionally required to predict the demise of CBLA.\nInstead, the court indulged in the “natural tendency to\nspeculate as to whether a different trial strategy might\nhave been more successful.” Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506\nU.S. 364, 372 (1993). To combat this tendency, we have\n“adopted the rule of contemporary assessment of counsel’s\nconduct.” Ibid. Had the Court of Appeals heeded this\nrule, it would have “judge[d] the reasonableness of coun-\nsel’s challenged conduct . . . viewed as of the time of coun-\nsel’s conduct.” Strickland, supra, at 690.\n   At the time of Kulbicki’s trial in 1995, the validity of\nCBLA was widely accepted, and courts regularly admitted\nCBLA evidence until 2003. See United States v. Higgs,\n663 F.3d 726, 738 (CA4 2011). As the Court of Appeals\nacknowledged, even the 1991 report itself did not question\nthe validity of CBLA, concluding that it was a valid and\n4                 MARYLAND v. KULBICKI\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nuseful forensic tool to match suspect to victim. 440 Md., at\n51, n. 11, 99 A.3d, at 740, n. 11. Counsel did not perform\ndeficiently by dedicating their time and focus to elements\nof the defense that did not involve poking methodological\nholes in a then-uncontroversial mode of ballistics analysis.\n   That is especially the case here, since there is no reason\nto believe that a diligent search would even have discov-\nered the supposedly crucial report. The Court of Appeals\noffered a single citation in support of its sweeping state-\nment that the report “was available” to Kulbicki’s counsel\nin 1995—a Government Printing Office Web page accessed\nby the Court of Appeals, apparently conducting its own\nInternet research nearly two decades after the trial. Id.,\nat 51, and n. 12, 99 A.3d, at 741, and n. 12; see also Brief\nin Opposition 14. The Web page indicates that a compila-\ntion of forensic studies that included the report was “dis-\ntributed to various public libraries in 1994.” 440 Md., at\n51, n. 12, 99 A.3d, at 741, n. 12. But which ones? And in\nan era of card catalogues, not a worldwide web, what\nefforts would counsel have had to expend to find the com-\npilation? And had they found it, would counsel really have\ncombed through the entire compilation, and have identi-\nfied the one (of many) findings in one of the reports, the\ndisregard of which counsel would have recognized to be “at\nodds with the scientific method”? And then, would effec-\ntive counsel really have brought to the attention of the\njury a report whose conclusion was that CBLA was a valid\ninvestigative technique in cases just like Kulbicki’s?\nNeither the Court of Appeals nor Kulbicki has answers.\nGiven the uncontroversial nature of CBLA at the time of\nKulbicki’s trial, the effect of the judgment below is to\ndemand that lawyers go “looking for a needle in a hay-\nstack,” even when they have “reason to doubt there is any\nneedle there.” Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 389\n(2005). The Court of Appeals demanded something close\nto “perfect advocacy”—far more than the “reasonable\n                  Cite as: 577 U. S. ____ (2015)            5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\ncompetence” the right to counsel guarantees. Yarborough\nv. Gentry, 540 U.S. 1, 8 (2003) (per curiam).\n   Kulbicki’s trial counsel did not provide deficient perfor-\nmance when they failed to uncover the 1991 report and\nto use the report’s so-called methodological flaw against\nPeele on cross-examination. (We need not, and so do not,\ndecide whether the supposed error prejudiced Kulbicki.)\nThe petition for writ of certiorari is granted, and the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for Maryland is\nreversed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

We deny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8.  Attwood is allowed until February 12, 1996, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliance with this Court's Rul e 33.  We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Attwood in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\n\n\n2\nAttwood has abused this Court's certiorari process.  In November 1995, we twice invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Attwood in forma pauperis status.  See Attwood v. Smith and Attwood v. Palm Beach Post, 516 U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 416, 133 L.Ed.2d 334. At that time, Attwood had filed seven petitions in this Court during the prior year, and he has filed two since.  All were patently frivolous and were denied without recorded dissent.\n\n\n3\nWe enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 397, 121 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Attwood's abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly.  The order will not prevent Attwood from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed against him.  The order will, however, allow this Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.\n\n\n4\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n5\nJustice STEVENS, dissenting.\n\n\n6\nBecause experience with the administration of orders like the one the Court is entering in this case today has merely reinforced my conviction that our \"limited resources\" would be used more effectively by simply denying petitions that are manifestly frivolous, I respectfully dissent.

Respondents, racetracks and a dog owners' association, filed a state-court suit challenging the law on the ground that the 20 percent/36 percent tax rate difference violated the Equal Protection Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1. The District Court upheld the statute, but the Iowa Supreme Court reversed.\n\nHeld:\n\n1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the state court's judgment, which does not rest independently upon state law. The state court's opinion says that Iowa courts should apply the same analysis in considering either state or federal equal protection claims. In such circumstances, this Court considers a state-court decision as resting upon federal grounds sufficient to support jurisdiction. P. 106.\n2. Iowa's differential tax rate does not violate the Federal Equal Protection Clause. A law, such as Iowa's, which distinguishes for tax purposes among revenues obtained within a State by two enterprises conducting business in the State, is subject to rational-basis review. See Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11-12. The Iowa law, like most laws, might predominantly serve one general objective, e. g., rescuing racetracks from economic distress, while containing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable (perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing a law that balances objectives but still serves the general objective when seen as a whole. And this law, seen as a whole, does what the state court says it seeks to do, namely, advance the racetracks' economic interests. A rational legislator might believe that the law's grant to the racetracks of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically—even if its simultaneous imposition of a tax on revenues means less help than respondents might like—and the Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help with their tax laws and how much help those laws should provide. Once one realizes that not every provision in a single law must share a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the difference in tax rates here. Though harmful to the racetracks, it is helpful to the riverboats, which were also facing financial peril. This is not a case where the facts preclude any plausible inference that the reason for the different tax rates is to help the riverboat industry. Cf. Nordlinger, supra, at 16. Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336, distinguished. Pp. 106-110.\n648 N.

Miller, Attorney General of Iowa, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Julie F. Pottorff, Deputy Attorney General, and Jeffrey D. Farrell and Jean M. Davis, Assistant Attorneys General.\n\n\n3\nKent L. Jones argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae urging reversal. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Olson, Assistant Attorney General O'Connor, David English Carmack, and Judith A. Hagley.\n\n\n4\nMark McCormick argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Thomas L. Flynn, Edward M. Mansfield, Stephen C. Krumpe, and Lawrence P. McLellan.*\n\n\n5\nJUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n6\nIowa taxes adjusted revenues from slot machines on excursion riverboats at a maximum rate of 20 percent. Iowa Code § 99F.11 (2003). Iowa law provides for a maximum tax rate of 36 percent on adjusted revenues from slot machines at racetracks. §§ 99F.4A(6), 99F.11. The Iowa Supreme Court held that this 20 percent/36 percent difference in tax rates violates the Federal Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, § 1. 648 N. W. 2d 555 (2002). We disagree and reverse the Iowa Supreme Court's determination.\n\n\n7\n* Before 1989, Iowa permitted only one form of gambling—parimutuel betting at racetracks—the proceeds of which it taxed at a six percent rate. Iowa Code § 99D.15 (1984). In 1989, it authorized other forms of gambling, including slot machines and other gambling games on riverboats, though it limited bets to $5 and losses to $200 per excursion. 1989 Iowa Acts ch. 67, §§ 3, 9(2); Iowa Code § 99F.3 (1996). Iowa taxed adjusted revenues from slot machine gambling at graduated rates, with a top rate of 20 percent. 1989 Iowa Acts ch. 67, § 11; Iowa Code § 99F.11 (1996).\n\n\n8\nIn 1994, Iowa enacted a law that, among other things, removed the riverboat gambling $5/$200 bet/loss limits, 1994 Iowa Acts ch. 1021, § 19, authorized racetracks to operate slot machines, § 13; Iowa Code §§ 99F.1(9), 99F.4A (1996), and imposed a graduated tax upon racetrack slot machine adjusted revenues with a top rate that started at 20 percent and would automatically rise over time to 36 percent, 1994 Iowa Acts ch. 1021, § 25; Iowa Code § 99F.11 (1996). The Act did not alter the tax rate on riverboat slot machine adjusted revenues, thereby leaving the existing 20 percent rate in place. Ibid.\n\n\n9\nRespondents, a group of racetracks and an association of dog owners, brought this lawsuit in state court challenging the 1994 legislation on the ground that the 20 percent/36 percent tax rate difference that it created violated the Federal Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, § 1. The State District Court upheld the statute. The Iowa Supreme Court disagreed and, by a 4-to-3 vote, reversed the District Court. The majority wrote that the \"differential tax completely defeats the alleged purpose\" of the statute, namely, \"to help the racetracks recover from economic distress,\" that there could \"be no rational reason for this differential tax,\" and that the Equal Protection Clause consequently forbids its imposition. 648 N. W. 2d, at 560-562. We granted certiorari to review this determination.\n\nII\n\n10\nRespondents initially claim that the Iowa Supreme Court's decision rests independently upon state law. And they argue that this state-law holding bars review of the federal issue. We disagree. The Iowa Supreme Court's opinion, after setting forth the language of both State and Federal Equal Protection Clauses, says that \"Iowa courts are to `apply the same analysis in considering the state equal protection claims as . . . in considering the federal equal protection claim.'\" Id., at 558. We have previously held that, in such circumstances, we shall consider a state-court decision as resting upon federal grounds sufficient to support this Court's jurisdiction. See Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U. S. 582, 588, n. 4 (1990) (no adequate and independent state ground where the court says that state and federal constitutional protections are \"`identical'\"). Cf. Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041-1042 (1983) (jurisdiction exists where federal cases are not \"being used only for the purpose of guidance\" and instead are \"compel[ling] the result\"). We therefore find that this Court has jurisdiction to review the Iowa Supreme Court's determination.\n\nIII\n\n11\nWe here consider whether a difference in state tax rates violates the Fourteenth Amendment's mandate that \"[n]o State shall... deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws,\" § 1. The law in question does not distinguish on the basis of, for example, race or gender. See, e. g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996). It does not distinguish between instate and out-of-state businesses. See, e. g., Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (1985). Neither does it favor a State's long-time residents at the expense of residents who have more recently arrived from other States. Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612 (1985). Rather, the law distinguishes for tax purposes among revenues obtained within the State of Iowa by two enterprises, each of which does business in the State. Where that is so, the law is subject to rational-basis review:\n\n\n12\n\"[T]he Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker, and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.\" Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1992) (citations omitted).\n\n\n13\nSee also id., at 11 (rational-basis review \"is especially deferential in the context of classifications made by complex tax laws\"); Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522, 527 (1959) (the Equal Protection Clause requires States, when enacting tax laws, to \"proceed upon a rational basis\" and not to \"resort to a classification that is palpably arbitrary\").\n\n\n14\nThe Iowa Supreme Court found that the 20 percent/36 percent tax rate differential failed to meet this standard because, in its view, that difference \"frustrated\" what it saw as the law's basic objective, namely, rescuing the racetracks from economic distress. 648 N. W. 2d, at 561. And no rational person, it believed, could claim the contrary. Id., at 561-562.\n\n\n15\nThe Iowa Supreme Court could not deny, however, that the Iowa law, like most laws, might predominantly serve one general objective, say, helping the racetracks, while containing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable (perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing a law that balances objectives but still serves the general objective when seen as a whole. See Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 181 (1980) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) (legislation is often the \"product of multiple and somewhat inconsistent purposes that led to certain compromises\"). After all, if every subsidiary provision in a law designed to help racetracks had to help those racetracks and nothing more, then (since any tax rate hurts the racetracks when compared with a lower rate) there could be no taxation of the racetracks at all.\n\n\n16\nNeither could the Iowa Supreme Court deny that the 1994 legislation, seen as a whole, can rationally be understood to do what that court says it seeks to do, namely, advance the racetracks' economic interests. Its grant to the racetracks of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically to some degree—even if its simultaneous imposition of a tax on slot machine adjusted revenues means that the law provides less help than respondents might like. At least a rational legislator might so believe. And the Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help with their tax laws and how much help those laws ought to provide. \"The `task of classifying persons for . . . benefits . . . inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line,' and the fact the line might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial, consideration.\" Id., at 179 (citation omitted). See also ibid. (judicial review is \"at an end\" once the court identifies a plausible basis on which the legislature may have relied); Nordlinger, supra, at 17-18.\n\n\n17\nOnce one realizes that not every provision in a law must share a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the 20 percent/36 percent differential here at issue. That difference, harmful to the racetracks, is helpful to the riverboats, which, as respondents concede, were also facing financial peril, Brief for Respondents 8. See also 648 N. W. 2d, at 557. These two characterizations are but opposite sides of the same coin. Each reflects a rational way for a legislator to view the matter. And aside from simply aiding the financial position of the riverboats, the legislators may have wanted to encourage the economic development of river communities or to promote riverboat history, say, by providing incentives for riverboats to remain in the State, rather than relocate to other States. See Gaming Study Committee Report (Sept. 3, 1993), reprinted in App. 76-84, 86. Alternatively, they may have wanted to protect the reliance interests of riverboat operators, whose adjusted slot machine revenue had previously been taxed at the 20 percent rate. All these objectives are rational ones, which lower riverboat tax rates could further and which suffice to uphold the different tax rates. See Allied Stores, supra, at 528; Nordlinger, supra, at 12. See also Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 88 (1940) (imposing burden on respondents to \"negative every conceivable basis\" that might support different treatment).\n\n\n18\nRespondents argue that Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989), holds to the contrary. Brief for Respondents 21. In that case, the Court held that substantial differences in the level of property tax assessments that West Virginia imposed upon similar properties violated the Federal Equal Protection Clause. But the Court later stated, when it upheld in Nordlinger a California statute creating similar differences in property taxes, that \"an obvious and critical factual difference between this case and Allegheny Pittsburgh is the absence of any indication in Allegheny Pittsburgh that the policies underlying an acquisition-value taxation scheme could conceivably have been the purpose for the . . . unequal assessment.\" 505 U. S., at 14-15. The Court in Nordlinger added that \"Allegheny Pittsburgh was the rare case where the facts precluded any plausible inference that the reason for the unequal assessment practice was to achieve the benefits of an acquisition-value tax scheme.\" Id., at 16-17, and n. 7. Here, \"the facts\" do not \"preclud[e]\" an inference that the reason for the different tax rates was to help the riverboat industry or the river communities. Id., at 16.\n\nIV\n\n19\nWe conclude that there is \"a plausible policy reason for the classification,\" that the legislature \"rationally may have . . . considered . . . true\" the related justifying \"legislative facts,\" and that the \"relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.\" Id., at 11. Consequently the State's differential tax rate does not violate the Federal Equal Protection Clause. The Iowa Supreme Court's judgment to the contrary is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n20\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Briefs ofamici curiae urging reversal were filed for the State of Missouri et al. by Jeremiah W.

Oklahoma and Texas shall release New Mexico from all claims for equitable or legal relief, other than the relief embodied in the Decree of the parties, arising out of New Mexico's violation of the Canadian River Compact during the years 1987 through the date this Stipulated Judgment is entered.\n\n\n11\n6. In the event of a conflict between this Judgment and the Decree entered in this case, the provisions of the Judgment shall control.\n\n\n12\n7. The costs of this case shall be equally divided among the parties.\n\nDECREE, AS MODIFIED\n\n13\n1. Under Article IV(a) of the Canadian River Compact (Compact), New Mexico is permitted free and unrestricted use of the waters of the Canadian River and its tributaries in New Mexico above Conchas Dam, such use to be made above or at Conchas Dam, including diversions for use on the Tucumcari Project and the Bell Ranch and the on-project storage of return flow or operational waste from those two projects so long as the recaptured water does not include the mainstream or tributary flows of the Canadian River; provided that transfers of water rights from above Conchas Dam to locations below Conchas Dam shall be subject to the conservation storage limitation of Compact Article IV(b). Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to determine whether or not the place of use of water rights may be transferred to locations outside the Canadian River basin in New Mexico.\n\n\n14\n2. Under Compact Article IV(b), New Mexico is limited to storage of no more than 200,000 acre-feet of the waters of the Canadian River and its tributaries, regardless of point of origin, at any time in reservoirs in the Canadian River basin in New Mexico below Conchas Dam for any beneficial use, exclusive of water stored for the exempt purposes specified in Compact Article II(d) and on-project storage of irrigation return flows or operational waste on the Tucumcari Project and Bell Ranch as provided for in Paragraph 1 of this Decree.\n\n\n15\n3. Quantities of water stored primarily for flood protection, power generation, or sediment control are not chargeable as conservation storage under the Compact even though incidental use is made of such waters for recreation, fish and wildlife, or other beneficial uses not expressly mentioned in the Compact. In situations where storage may be for multiple purposes, including both conservation storage and exempt storage, nothing in this Decree shall preclude the Canadian River Commission (Commission) from exempting an appropriate portion of such storage from chargeability as conservation storage.\n\n\n16\n4. Water stored at elevations below a dam's lowest permanent outlet works is not chargeable as conservation storage under the Compact unless the primary use of that storage is for a nonexempt purpose, or unless other means, such as pumps, are utilized to discharge such storage volumes from the reservoir. No change in the location of a dam's lowest permanent outlet works to a higher elevation shall provide the basis for a claim of exempt status for all water stored below the relocated outlet works without prior approval of the Commission, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Water stored for nonexempt purposes behind a dam with capacity in excess of 100 acre-feet and with no outlet works is chargeable as conservation storage.\n\n\n17\n5. Future designation or redesignation of storage volumes for flood control, power production, or sediment control purposes must receive prior Commission approval to be exempt from chargeability as conservation storage, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n\n18\n6. All water stored in Ute Reservoir above elevation 3,725 feet is conservation storage; provided that at such time as the authorization and funding of the Eastern New Mexico Water Supply Project or other project results in changed circumstances at Ute Reservoir, New Mexico may seek exemption of a reasonable portion of such water from the Commission under Paragraph 5 of this Decree and, if an exemption is denied, may petition the Court for appropriate relief under Paragraph 11 of this Decree.\n\n\n19\n7. In 1988 there were 63 small reservoirs in New Mexico with capacities of 100 acre-feet or less with a total capacity of about 1,000 acre-feet, which the Commission has treated as de minimis by waiving storage volume reporting obligations. Water stored in these reservoirs or in similarly sized reservoirs in the future is not chargeable as conservation storage, unless otherwise determined by the Commission.\n\n\n20\n8. Based on the elevation-capacity relationship of Ute Reservoir effective January 1, 1993, and adjustments pursuant to Paragraph 9 of this Decree, New Mexico shall make and maintain appropriate releases of water from Ute Reservoir or other conservation storage facilities in excess of 100 acre-feet of capacity at the maximum rate consistent with safe operation of such reservoirs so that total conservation storage in the Canadian River basin below Conchas Dam in New Mexico is limited to no more than 200,000 acre-feet at any time; provided that operation of Ute Reservoir for the period 1993-2002 shall be pursuant to the schedule contained in the Judgment entered in this case; and provided that no violation of this paragraph will occur during any period in which the outlet works of Ute Reservoir are discharging water at the maximum safe discharge capacity (currently 350 cubic feet per second) following the first knowledge that the 1993-2002 schedule or the Article IV(b) limitation after 2002 probably would be exceeded; and provided further that Texas shall be notified by New Mexico prior to a release and may allow New Mexico to retain water in conservation storage in excess of the 1993-2002 schedule or the Article IV(b) limitation after 2002, subject to the call of Texas and subject to the provisions of Article V of the Compact. The outlet works of Ute Reservoir shall be maintained in good working order and shall not be modified to reduce the safe discharge capacity without prior approval of the Commission, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n\n21\n9. Sediment surveys of Ute Reservoir shall be conducted at least every 10 years by New Mexico, unless such requirement is waived by the Commission. Conservation storage in Ute Reservoir shall be determined from the most recent sediment survey and an annual estimate of the total additional sediment deposition in the reservoir using an annual average of sediment accumulation during the period between 1963 and the most recently completed survey.\n\n\n22\n10. Nothing in this Decree is intended to affect a State's rights or obligations under the Compact, except as specifically addressed herein.\n\n\n23\n11. The Court retains jurisdiction of this suit for the purposes of any order, direction, or modification of this Decree, or any supplementary decree, that may at any time be deemed proper in relation to the subject matter in controversy; provided, that any party requesting the Court to exercise its jurisdiction under this paragraph or answering such request shall certify that it has attempted to negotiate in good faith with the other parties in an effort to resolve the dispute sought to be brought before the Court.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

However, in the last four months, he has suddenly increased his filings and now has 10 petitions pending before this Court, all of them patently frivolous.\nHeld: Sassower is denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis in the instant cases, pursuant to this Court's Rule 39.8, and the Clerk is directed not to accept any further petitions for certiorari nor any petitions for extraordinary writs from him in noncriminal matters, unless he pays the required docketing fee and submits his petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. For the important reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177, and In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, the Court feels compelled to enter this order, which will allow the Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who, unlike Sassower, have not abused the Court's process.\nMotions denied.\nON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPro se petitioner George Sassower requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Sassower is allowed until November 2, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. For the reasons explained below, we also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari nor any petitions for extraordinary writs from Sassower in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\n\n\n2\nPrior to this Term, Sassower had filed 11 petitions in this Court over the last three years. Although Sassower was granted in forma pauperis status to file these petitions, all were denied without recorded dissent.* During the last four months, Sassower has suddenly increased his filings. He currently has 10 petitions pending before this Court—all of them patently frivolous.\n\n\n3\nAlthough we have not previously denied Sassower in forma pauperis status pursuant to Rule 39.8, we think it appropriate to enter an order pursuant to Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992). In both In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991) (per curiam), and In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180 (1989) (per curiam), we entered orders similar to this one without having previously denied petitioners' motions to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39.8. For the important reasons discussed in Martin, Sindram, and McDonald, we feel compelled to enter the order today barring prospective filings from Sassower.\n\n\n4\nSassower's abuse of the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly.

EDDIE LEE \n\n                HOWARD ET AL. \n\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                 COURT OF OKLAHOMA\n\n            No. 11–1377. Decided November 26, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  State courts rather than federal courts are most fre­\nquently called upon to apply the Federal Arbitration Act\n(FAA), 9 U.S. C. §1 et seq., including the Act’s national\npolicy favoring arbitration. It is a matter of great im­\nportance, therefore, that state supreme courts adhere to a\ncorrect interpretation of the legislation. Here, the Okla­\nhoma Supreme Court failed to do so. By declaring the\nnoncompetition agreements in two employment contracts\nnull and void, rather than leaving that determination to\nthe arbitrator in the first instance, the state court ignored\na basic tenet of the Act’s substantive arbitration law. The\ndecision must be vacated.\n                       *    *     *\n  This dispute arises from a contract between petitioner\nNitro-Lift Technologies, L. L. C., and two of its former\nemployees. Nitro-Lift contracts with operators of oil and\ngas wells to provide services that enhance production.\nRespondents Eddie Lee Howard and Shane D. Schneider\nentered a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement\nwith Nitro-Lift that contained the following arbitration\nclause:\n    “ ‘Any dispute, difference or unresolved question be­\n    tween Nitro-Lift and the Employee (collectively the\n    “Disputing Parties”) shall be settled by arbitration by\n    a single arbitrator mutually agreeable to the Disput­\n    ing Parties in an arbitration proceeding conducted in\n2      NITRO-LIFT TECHNOLOGIES, L. L. C. v. HOWARD\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    Houston, Texas in accordance with the rules existing\n    at the date hereof of the American Arbitration Associ­\n    ation.’ ” Pet. for Cert. 5.\nAfter working for Nitro-Lift on wells in Oklahoma, Texas,\nand Arkansas, respondents quit and began working for\none of Nitro-Lift’s competitors. Claiming that respondents\nhad breached their noncompetition agreements, Nitro-Lift\nserved them with a demand for arbitration. Respondents\nthen filed suit in the District Court of Johnston County,\nOklahoma, asking the court to declare the noncompetition\nagreements null and void and to enjoin their enforcement.\nThe court dismissed the complaint, finding that the con­\ntracts contained valid arbitration clauses under which an\narbitrator, and not the court, must settle the parties’\ndisagreement.\n  The Oklahoma Supreme Court retained respondents’\nappeal and ordered the parties to show cause why the\nmatter should not be resolved by application of Okla.\nStat., Tit. 15, §219A (West 2011), which limits the en­\nforceability of noncompetition agreements.         Nitro-Lift\nargued that any dispute as to the contracts’ enforceability\nwas a question for the arbitrator. It relied for support—\nas it had done before the trial court—upon several of this\nCourt’s cases interpreting the FAA, and noted that under\nBuckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440,\n446 (2006), “this arbitration law applies in both state and\nfederal courts.” Record in No. 109,003 (Okla.), p. 273.\n  The Oklahoma Supreme Court was not persuaded. It\nheld that despite the “[U. S.] Supreme Court cases on\nwhich the employers rely,” the “existence of an arbitration\nagreement in an employment contract does not prohibit\njudicial review of the underlying agreement.” 2011 OK 98,\n¶15, n. 20, ¶16, 273 P.3d 20, 26, n. 20, 27. For that prop­\nosition, the court relied on the “exhaustive overview of\nthe United States Supreme Court decisions construing the\nFederal Arbitration Act” in Bruner v. Timberlane Manor\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nLtd. Partnership, 2006 OK 90, 155 P.3d 16, which found\nSupreme Court jurisprudence “not to inhibit our review\nof the underlying contract’s validity.” 273 P. 3d, at 26.\nFinding the arbitration clauses no obstacle to its review,\nthe court held that the noncompetition agreements were\n“void and unenforceable as against Oklahoma’s public\npolicy,” expressed in Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, §219A. 273 P. 3d,\nat 27.\n   The Oklahoma Supreme Court declared that its decision\nrests on adequate and independent state grounds. Id., at\n23–24, n. 5. If that were so, we would have no jurisdiction\nover this case. See Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032,\n1037–1044 (1983). It is not so, however, because the\ncourt’s reliance on Oklahoma law was not “independent”—\nit necessarily depended upon a rejection of the federal\nclaim, which was both “ ‘properly presented to’ ” and “ ‘ad­\ndressed by’ ” the state court. Howell v. Mississippi, 543\nU.S. 440, 443 (2005) (per curiam) (quoting Adams v.\nRobertson, 520 U.S. 83, 86 (1997) (per curiam)). Nitro-\nLift claimed that the arbitrator should decide the con­\ntract’s validity, and raised a federal-law basis for that\nclaim by relying on Supreme Court cases construing the\nFAA. “ ‘[A] litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can\neasily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a\nstate-court petition or brief . . . by citing in conjunction\nwith the claim the federal source of law on which he relies\nor a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds . . . .’ ”\nHowell, supra, at 444 (quoting Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U.S.\n27, 32 (2004); emphasis added). The Oklahoma Supreme\nCourt acknowledged the cases on which Nitro-Lift relied,\nas well as their relevant holdings, but chose to discount\nthese controlling decisions. Its conclusion that, despite\nthis Court’s jurisprudence, the underlying contract’s valid­\nity is purely a matter of state law for state-court deter­\nmination is all the more reason for this Court to assert\njurisdiction.\n4      NITRO-LIFT TECHNOLOGIES, L. L. C. v. HOWARD\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    The Oklahoma Supreme Court’s decision disregards this\nCourt’s precedents on the FAA. That Act, which “de­\nclare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration,” Southland\nCorp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 10 (1984), provides that a\n“written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transac­\ntion involving commerce to settle by arbitration a contro­\nversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction\n. . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.” 9 U.S. C. §2. It is well settled that\n“the substantive law the Act created [is] applicable in state\nand federal courts.” Southland Corp., supra, at 12; see\nalso Buckeye, supra, at 446. And when parties commit to\narbitrate contractual disputes, it is a mainstay of the Act’s\nsubstantive law that attacks on the validity of the con­\ntract, as distinct from attacks on the validity of the arbi­\ntration clause itself, are to be resolved “by the arbitrator\nin the first instance, not by a federal or state court.”\nPreston v. Ferrer, 552 U.S. 346, 349 (2008); see also Prima\nPaint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395\n(1967). For these purposes, an “arbitration provision is\nseverable from the remainder of the contract,” Buckeye,\nsupra, at 445, and its validity is subject to initial court\ndetermination; but the validity of the remainder of the\ncontract (if the arbitration provision is valid) is for the\narbitrator to decide.\n    This principle requires that the decision below be va­\ncated. The trial court found that the contract contained a\nvalid arbitration clause, and the Oklahoma Supreme\nCourt did not hold otherwise. It nonetheless assumed the\narbitrator’s role by declaring the noncompetition agree­\nments null and void. The state court insisted that its\n“[own] jurisprudence controls this issue” and permits\nreview of a “contract submitted to arbitration where one\nparty assert[s] that the underlying agreement [is] void and\nunenforceable.” 273 P. 3d, at 26. But the Oklahoma\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nSupreme Court must abide by the FAA, which is “the\nsupreme Law of the Land,” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, and\nby the opinions of this Court interpreting that law. “It\nis this Court’s responsibility to say what a statute means,\nand once the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other\ncourts to respect that understanding of the governing rule\nof law.” Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298,\n312 (1994). Our cases hold that the FAA forecloses pre­\ncisely this type of “judicial hostility towards arbitration.”\nAT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 8).\n   The state court reasoned that Oklahoma’s statute “ad­\ndressing the validity of covenants not to compete, must\ngovern over the more general statute favoring arbitration.”\n273 P. 3d, at 26, n. 21. But the ancient interpretive prin­\nciple that the specific governs the general (generalia spe-\ncialibus non derogant) applies only to conflict between\nlaws of equivalent dignity. Where a specific statute, for\nexample, conflicts with a general constitutional provision,\nthe latter governs. And the same is true where a specific\nstate statute conflicts with a general federal statute.\nThere is no general-specific exception to the Supremacy\nClause, U. S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2. “ ‘[W]hen state law\nprohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of\nclaim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule\nis displaced by the FAA.’ ” Marmet Health Care Center,\nInc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 3–4) (quoting AT&T Mobility LLC, supra, at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–7)). Hence, it is for the arbitrator to\ndecide in the first instance whether the covenants not to\ncompete are valid as a matter of applicable state law. See\nBuckeye, 546 U. S., at 445–446.\n   For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is\ngranted. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklaho­\nma is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Relying on Fifth Circuit precedent, the District Court held that Oncale, a male, had no Title VII cause of action for harassment by male coworkers.  The  Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Sex discrimination consisting of same-sex sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII. Title VII's prohibition of discrimination \"because of  . . .  sex'' protects men as well as women, Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U.S. 669, 682, 103 S.Ct. 2622, 2630, 77 L.Ed.2d 89, and in the related context of racial discrimination in the workplace this Court has rejected any conclusive presumption that an employer will not discriminate against members of his own race, Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 499, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1282-1283, 51 L.Ed.2d 498.  There is no justification in Title VII's language or the Court's precedents for a categorical rule barring a claim of discrimination \"because of  . . .  sex'' merely because the plaintiff and the defendant (or the person charged with acting on behalf of the defendant) are of the same sex.  Recognizing liability for same-sex harassment will not transform Title VII into a general civility code for the American workplace, since Title VII is directed at discrimination because of sex, not merely conduct tinged with offensive sexual connotations; since the statute does not reach genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same, and the opposite, sex; and since the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering all the circumstances. Pp. ____-____.\n83 F.3d 118, reversed and remanded.\nSCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  THOMAS, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nNicholas Canaday, III, Baton Rouge, LA, for petitioner.\nEdwin S. Kneedler, Washington, DC, for U.S.\nHarry M. Reasoner, Houston, TX, for respondents.\nJustice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents the question whether workplace harassment can violate Title VII's prohibition against \"discriminat[ion]  . . .  because of  . . .  sex,'' 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a)(1), when the harasser and the harassed employee are of the same sex.\n\n\n2\n* The District Court having granted summary judgment for respondent, we must assume the facts to be as alleged by petitioner Joseph Oncale.  The precise details are irrelevant to the legal point we must decide, and in the interest of both brevity and dignity we shall describe them only generally.  In late October 1991, Oncale was working for respondent Sundowner Offshore Services on a Chevron U.S. A., Inc., oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico.  He was employed as a roustabout on an eight-man crew which included respondents John Lyons, Danny Pippen, and Brandon Johnson.  Lyons, the crane operator, and Pippen, the driller, had supervisory authority, App. 41, 77, 43.  On several occasions, Oncale was forcibly subjected to sex-related, humiliating actions against him by Lyons, Pippen and Johnson in the presence of the rest of the crew.  Pippen and Lyons also physically assaulted Oncale in a sexual manner, and Lyons threatened him with rape.\n\n\n3\nOncale's complaints to supervisory personnel produced no remedial action; in fact, the company's Safety Compliance Clerk, Valent Hohen, told Oncale that Lyons and Pippen \"picked [on] him all the time too,'' and called him a name suggesting homosexuality. Id., at 77.  Oncale eventually quit-asking that his pink slip reflect that he \"voluntarily left due to sexual harassment and verbal abuse.'' Id., at 79.  When asked at his deposition why he left Sundowner, Oncale stated \"I felt that if I didn't leave my job, that I would be raped or forced to have sex.'' Id., at 71.\n\n\n4\nOncale filed a complaint against Sundowner in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging that he was discriminated against in his employment because of his sex.  Relying on the Fifth Circuit's decision in Garcia v. Elf Atochem North America, 28 F.3d 446, 451-452 (C.A.5 1994), the district court held that \"Mr. Oncale, a male, has no cause of action under Title VII for harassment by male co-workers.''  App. 106.  On appeal, a panel of the Fifth Circuit concluded that Garcia was binding Circuit precedent, and affirmed. 83 F.3d 118 (1996).  We granted certiorari. 520 U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2430, 138 L.Ed.2d 192 (1997).\n\nII\n\n5\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides, in relevant part, that \" [i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer  . . .  to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.'' 78 Stat. 255, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a)(1).  We have held that this not only covers \"terms'' and \"conditions'' in the narrow contractual sense, but \"evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment.'' Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \"When the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult  that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions  of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.'' Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n6\nTitle VII's prohibition of discrimination \"because of  . . . sex'' protects men as well as women, Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U.S. 669, 682, 103 S.Ct. 2622, 2630, 77 L.Ed.2d 89 (1983), and in the related context of racial discrimination in the workplace we have rejected any conclusive presumption that an employer will not discriminate against members of his own race. \"Because of the many facets of human motivation, it would be unwise to presume as a matter of law that human beings of one definable group will not discriminate against other members of that group.'' Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 499, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1282, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977).  See also id., at 514 n. 6, 97 S.Ct., at 1290 n. 6 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C.J., and REHNQUIST, J., dissenting).  In Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U.S. 616, 107 S.Ct.  1442, 94 L.Ed.2d 615 (1987), a male employee claimed that his employer discriminated against him because of his sex when it preferred a female employee for promotion.  Although we ultimately rejected the claim on other grounds, we did not consider it significant that the supervisor who made that decision was also a man.  See id., at 624-625, 107 S.Ct., at 1447-1448.  If our precedents leave any doubt on the question, we hold today that nothing in Title VII necessarily bars a claim of  discrimination \"because of  . . .  sex'' merely because the plaintiff and the defendant (or the person charged with acting on behalf of the defendant) are of the same sex.\n\n\n7\nCourts have had little trouble with that principle in cases like Johnson, where an employee claims to have been passed over for a job or promotion.  But when the issue arises in the context of a \"hostile environment'' sexual harassment claim, the state and federal courts have taken a bewildering variety of stances. Some, like the Fifth Circuit in this case, have held that same-sex sexual harassment claims are never cognizable under Title VII. See also, e.g., Goluszek v. H.P. Smith, 697 F.Supp. 1452 (N.D.Ill.1988).  Other decisions say that such claims are actionable only if the plaintiff can prove that the harasser is homosexual (and thus presumably motivated by sexual desire). Compare McWilliams v. Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, 72 F.3d 1191 (C.A.4 1996), with Wrightson v. Pizza Hut of America, 99 F.3d 138 (C.A.4 1996).  Still others suggest that workplace harassment that is sexual in content is always actionable, regardless of the harasser's sex, sexual orientation, or motivations.  See Doe v. Belleville, 119 F.3d 563 (C.A.7 1997).\n\n\n8\nWe see no justification in the statutory language or our precedents for a categorical rule excluding same-sex harassment claims from the coverage of Title VII. As some courts have observed, male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII.  But statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.   Title VII prohibits \"discriminat[ion]  . . .  because of  . . .   sex'' in the \"terms'' or \"conditions'' of employment.  Our holding that this includes sexual harassment must extend to sexual harassment of any kind that meets the statutory requirements.\n\n\n9\nRespondents and their amici contend that recognizing liability for same-sex harassment will transform Title VII into a general civility code for the American workplace.  But that risk is no greater for same-sex than for opposite-sex harassment, and is adequately met by careful attention to the requirements of the statute.  Title VII does not prohibit all verbal or physical harassment in the workplace; it is directed only at \"discriminat[ion] . . .  because of  . . .  sex.''  We have never held that workplace harassment, even harassment between men and women, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations. \"The critical issue, Title VII's text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.'' Harris, supra, at 25, 114 S.Ct., at 372 (GINSBURG, J., concurring).\n\n\n10\nCourts and juries have found the inference of discrimination easy to draw in most male-female sexual harassment situations, because the challenged conduct typically involves explicit or implicit proposals of sexual activity; it is reasonable to assume those proposals would not have been made to someone of the same sex.  The same chain of inference would be available to a plaintiff alleging same-sex harassment, if there were credible evidence that the harasser was homosexual.  But harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to support an inference of discrimination on the basis of sex.  A trier of fact might reasonably find such discrimination, for example, if a female victim is harassed in such sex-specific and derogatory terms by another woman as to make it clear that the harasser is motivated by general hostility to the presence of women in the workplace. A same-sex harassment plaintiff may also, of course, offer direct comparative evidence about how the alleged harasser treated members of both sexes in a mixed-sex workplace.  Whatever evidentiary route the plaintiff chooses to follow, he or she must always prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations, but actually constituted \"discrimina[tion] . . .  because of  . . .  sex.''\n\n\n11\nAnd there is another requirement that prevents Title VII from expanding into a general civility code: As we emphasized in Meritor and Harris, the statute does not reach genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex.  The prohibition of harassment on the basis of sex requires neither asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace; it forbids only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the \"conditions'' of the victim's employment. \"Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment-an environment that a reasonable person  would find hostile or abusive-is beyond Title VII's purview.'' Harris, 510 U.S., at 21, 114 S.Ct., at 370, citing Meritor, 477 U.S., at 67, 106 S.Ct., at 2405-2406.  We have always regarded that requirement as crucial, and as sufficient to ensure that courts and juries do not mistake ordinary socializing in the workplace-such as male-on-male horseplay or intersexual flirtation-for discriminatory \"conditions of employment.''\n\n\n12\nWe have emphasized, moreover, that the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering \"all the circumstances.'' Harris, supra, at 23, 114 S.Ct., at 371.  In same-sex (as in all) harassment cases, that inquiry requires careful consideration of the social context in which particular behavior occurs and is experienced by its target.  A professional football player's working environment is not severely or pervasively abusive, for example, if the coach smacks him on the buttocks as he heads onto the field-even if the same behavior would reasonably be experienced as abusive by the coach's secretary (male or female) back at the office.  The real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.  Common sense, and an appropriate sensitivity to social context, will enable courts and juries to distinguish between simple teasing or roughhousing among members of the same sex, and conduct which a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would find severely hostile or abusive.\n\nIII\n\n13\nBecause we conclude that sex discrimination consisting of same-sex sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n14\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n15\nJustice THOMAS, concurring.\n\n\n16\nI concur because the Court stresses that in every sexual harassment case, the plaintiff must plead and ultimately prove Title VII's statutory requirement that there be discrimination \"because of  . . .  sex.''\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

He then fled while released on bail, and the court issued an arrest warrant. When that warrant was finally executed 10 years later, the State reinstated the possession charge, informing respondent that the police, acting under established procedures, had destroyed the substance seized during his arrest. Respondent formally requested production of the substance and moved to dismiss the charge based on the destruction of evidence. The trial court denied his motion, and he was convicted. The Appellate Court reversed, holding that the Due Process Clause required dismissal of the charge and finding that such a result was not foreclosed by Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58, in which this Court held that \"unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\"\nHeld: Respondent has failed to establish a due process violation. While the prosecution's good or bad faith is irrelevant when a State suppresses or fails to disclose material exculpatory evidence, Youngblood recognizes that bad faith is relevant when dealing with the State's failure to preserve \"potentially useful evidence.\" The substance seized here was plainly the latter sort of evidence. At most, respondent could hope that a fifth test of the substance would have exonerated him. He did not allege, nor did the Appellate Court find, that the police acted in bad faith in destroying the substance. To the contrary, police testing inculpated respondent, and the police acted in good faith and in accord with their normal practice. This Court has never held or suggested that the existence of a pending discovery request eliminates the necessity of a bad-faith showing. Nor does the Court agree that Youngblood does not apply when the contested evidence is a defendant's only hope for exoneration and is essential to the case's outcome. The Youngblood bad-faith requirement's applicability depends not on the contested evidence's centrality to the case, but on the distinction between \"material exculpatory\" evidence and \"potentially useful\" evidence. 488 U.S., at 57-58.\nCertiorari granted; reversed and remanded.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS, FIRST DISTRICT.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe Appellate Court of Illinois held here that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause required the dismissal of criminal charges because the police, acting in good faith and according to normal police procedures, destroyed evidence that respondent had requested more than 10 years earlier in a discovery motion. Petitioner, the State of Illinois, contends that such a result is foreclosed by our decision in Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988). There we held that \"unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\" Id., at 58. We agree with petitioner, grant the petition for certiorari and respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n\n\n2\nIn September 1988, Chicago police arrested respondent in the course of a traffic stop during which police observed him furtively attempting to conceal a plastic bag containing a white powdery substance. Four tests conducted by the Chicago Police Crime Lab and the Illinois State Police Crime Lab confirmed that the bag seized from respondent contained cocaine.\n\n\n3\nRespondent was charged with possession of cocaine in the Circuit Court of Cook County in October 1988. He filed a motion for discovery eight days later requesting all physical evidence the State intended to use at trial. The State responded that all evidence would be made available at a reasonable time and date upon request. Respondent was released on bond pending trial. In July 1989, however, he failed to appear in court, and the court issued an arrest warrant to secure his presence. Respondent remained a fugitive for over 10 years, apparently settling in Tennessee. The outstanding arrest warrant was finally executed in November 1999, after respondent was detained on an unrelated matter. The State then reinstated the 1988 cocaine-possession charge.\n\n\n4\nBefore trial, the State informed respondent that in September 1999, the police, acting in accord with established procedures, had destroyed the substance seized from him during his arrest. Respondent thereupon formally requested production of the substance and filed a motion to dismiss the cocaine-possession charge based on the State's destruction of evidence. The trial court denied the motion, and the case proceeded to a jury trial. The State introduced evidence tending to prove the facts recounted above. Respondent's case in chief consisted solely of his own testimony, in which he denied that he ever possessed cocaine and insinuated that the police had \"framed\" him for the crime. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and respondent was sentenced to one year of imprisonment.\n\n\n5\nThe Appellate Court reversed the conviction, holding that the Due Process Clause required dismissal of the charge. Relying on the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in Illinois v. Newberry, 166 Ill. 2d 310, 652 N. E. 2d 288 (1995), the Appellate Court reasoned:\n\n\n6\n\"`Where evidence is requested by the defense in a discovery motion, the State is on notice that the evidence must be preserved, and the defense is not required to make an independent showing that the evidence has exculpatory value in order to establish a due process violation. If the State proceeds to destroy the evidence, appropriate sanctions may be imposed even if the destruction is inadvertent. No showing of bad faith is necessary.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 12 (quoting Newberry, supra, at 317, 652 N. E. 2d, at 292) (citation omitted in original).\n\n\n7\nThe Appellate Court observed that Newberry distinguished our decision in Youngblood on the ground that the police in Youngblood did not destroy evidence subsequent to a discovery motion by the defendant. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13. While acknowledging that \"there is nothing in the record to indicate that the alleged cocaine was destroyed in bad faith,\" id., at 15, the court further determined that Newberry dictated dismissal because, unlike in Youngblood, the destroyed evidence provided respondent's \"only hope for exoneration,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 15, and was \"`essential to and determinative of the outcome of the case,'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 16 (quoting Newberry, supra, at 315, 652 N. E. 2d, at 291). Consequently, the court concluded that respondent \"was denied due process when he was tried subsequent to the destruction of the alleged cocaine.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 16. The Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.*\n\n\n8\nWe have held that when the State suppresses or fails to disclose material exculpatory evidence, the good or bad faith of the prosecution is irrelevant: a due process violation occurs whenever such evidence is withheld. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963); United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976). In Youngblood, by contrast, we recognized that the Due Process Clause \"requires a different result when we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.\" 488 U.S., at 57. We concluded that the failure to preserve this \"potentially useful evidence\" does not violate due process \"unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police.\" Id., at 58 (emphasis added).\n\n\n9\nThe substance seized from respondent was plainly the sort of \"potentially useful evidence\" referred to in Youngblood, not the material exculpatory evidence addressed in Brady and Agurs. At most, respondent could hope that, had the evidence been preserved, a fifth test conducted on the substance would have exonerated him. See Youngblood, 488 U. S., at 57. But respondent did not allege, nor did the Appellate Court find, that the Chicago police acted in bad faith when they destroyed the substance. Quite the contrary, police testing indicated that the chemical makeup of the substance inculpated, not exculpated, respondent, see id., at 57, n., and it is undisputed that police acted in \"good faith and in accord with their normal practice,\" id., at 56 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting California v. Trombetta, 467 U. S. 479, 488 (1984), in turn quoting Killian v. United States, 368 U. S. 231, 242 (1961)). Under Youngblood, then, respondent has failed to establish a due process violation.\n\n\n10\nWe have never held or suggested that the existence of a pending discovery request eliminates the necessity of showing bad faith on the part of police. Indeed, the result reached in this case demonstrates why such a per se rule would negate the very reason we adopted the bad-faith requirement in the first place: to \"limi[t] the extent of the police's obligation to preserve evidence to reasonable grounds and confin[e] it to that class of cases where the interests of justice most clearly require it.\" 488 U. S., at 58.\n\n\n11\nWe also disagree that Youngblood does not apply whenever the contested evidence provides a defendant's \"only hope for exoneration\" and is \"`essential to and determinative of the outcome of the case.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 15-16 (citing Newberry, 166 Ill. 2d, at 315, 652 N. E. 2d, at 291). In Youngblood, the Arizona Court of Appeals said that the destroyed evidence \"could [have] eliminate[d] the defendant as the perpetrator.\" 488 U. S., at 54 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Similarly here, an additional test might have provided the defendant with an opportunity to show that the police tests were mistaken. It is thus difficult to distinguish the two cases on this basis. But in any event, the applicability of the bad-faith requirement in Youngblood depended not on the centrality of the contested evidence to the prosecution's case or the defendant's defense, but on the distinction between \"material exculpatory\" evidence and \"potentially useful\" evidence. 488 U. S., at 57-58. As we have held, supra, at 548, the substance destroyed here was, at best, \"potentially useful\" evidence, and therefore Youngblood's bad-faith requirement applies.\n\n\n12\nThe judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n13\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Respondent suggests that we lack jurisdiction because the Appellate Court relied onNewberry, which in turn relied on an adequate and independent state ground. See, e. g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1040-1042 (1983). Respondent is correct that Newberry relied on both the Due Process Clause, and in the alternative, Illinois Supreme Court Rule 415(g)(i) (1990). 166 Ill. 2d, at 314-317, 652 N. E. 2d, at 290-292. The Appellate Court, however, relied only on the portion of Newberry that addressed due process, and the Appellate Court based its decision solely on the Due Process Clause. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review that decision. See, e. g., Long, supra, at 1038, n. 4 (\"We may review a state case decided on a federal ground even if it is clear that there was an available state ground for decision on which the state court could properly have relied\" (citing Beecher v. Alabama, 389 U. S. 35, 37, n. 3 (1967) (per curiam))).\n\n\n\n14\nJUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n15\nWhile I did not join the three Justices who dissented in Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S. 51 (1988), I also declined to join the majority opinion because I was convinced then, and remain convinced today, that \"there may well be cases in which the defendant is unable to prove that the State acted in bad faith but in which the loss or destruction of evidence is nonetheless so critical to the defense as to make a criminal trial fundamentally unfair.\" Id., at 61 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).* This, like Youngblood, is not such a case.\n\n\n16\nNeither is it a case that merited review in this Court, however. The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court has limited precedential value, and may well be reinstated on remand because the result is supported by the state-law holding in People v. Newberry, 166 Ill. 2d 310, 652 N. E. 2d 288 (1995). See ante, n. In my judgment the State's petition for a writ of certiorari should have been denied.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Youngblood's focus on the subjective motivation of the police represents a break with our usual understanding that the presence or absence of constitutional error in suppression of evidence cases depends on the character of the evidence, not the character of the person who withholds it. United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 110 (1976). Since Youngblood was decided, a number of state courts have held as a matter of state constitutional law that the loss or destruction of evidence critical to the defense does violate due process, even in the absence of bad faith. As the Connecticut Supreme Court has explained, \"[f]airness dictates that when a person's liberty is at stake, the sole fact of whether the police or another state official acted in good or bad faith in failing to preserve evidence cannot be determinative of whether the criminal defendant received due process of law.\" State v. Morales, 232 Conn. 707, 723, 657 A. 2d 585, 593 (1995) (footnote omitted). See also State v. Ferguson, 2 S. W. 3d 912, 916-917 (Tenn. 1999); State v. Osakalumi, 194 W. Va. 758, 765-767, 461 S.

Maynard, Assistant to the Solicitor General, Bruce R. Ellisen, Teresa T. Milton, Attorneys Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nJustice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\nThis is a challenge to the Internal Revenue Service's levy upon the property of a trust, to collect taxes owed by another, an action specifically authorized by 26 U.S.C. § 7426(a)(1), but subject to a statutory filing deadline the trust missed. The question is whether the trust may still challenge the levy through an action for tax refund under 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1). We hold that it may not.\n\nI\nThe Internal Revenue Code provides that \"[i]f any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount ... shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person.\" 26 U.S.C. § 6321. \"A federal tax lien, however, is not self-executing,\" and the IRS must take \"[a]ffirmative action... to enforce collection of the unpaid taxes.\" United States v. National Bank of Commerce, 472 U.S. 713, 720, 105 S. Ct. 2919, 86 L. Ed. 2d 565 (1985). One of its \"principal tools,\" ibid., is a levy, which is a \"legally sanctioned seizure and sale of property,\" Black's Law Dictionary 926 (8th ed.2004); see also § 6331(b) (\"The term `levy' as used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means\").\nTo protect against a \"`wrongful'\" imposition upon \"property which is not the taxpayer's,\" S.Rep. No. 1708, 89th Cong., *1766 2d Sess., 30 (1966), the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 added § 7426(a)(1), providing that \"[i]f a levy has been made on property... any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in ... such property and that such property was wrongfully levied upon may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court.\" 80 Stat. 1143. The action must, however, be brought before \"the expiration of 9 months from the date of the levy.\"[1] § 6532(c)(1). This short limitations period contrasts with its counterpart in a tax refund action under 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1), which begins with an administrative claim that may be filed within at least two years, and may be brought to court within another two after an administrative denial.[2] The demand for greater haste when a third party contests a levy is no accident; as the Government explained in the hearings before passage of the Act, \"[s]ince after seizure of property for nonpayment of taxes [an IRS] district director is likely to suspend further collection activities against the taxpayer, it is essential that he be advised promptly if he has seized property which does not belong to the taxpayer.\" Hearings on H.R. 11256 and H.R. 11290 before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 57-58 (1966) (written statement of Stanley S. Surrey, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury); see also id., at 72 (statement of Laurens Williams, Chairman, Special Committee on Federal Liens, American Bar Association) (\"A short (9 month) statute of limitations is provided, because it is important to get such controversies decided quickly so the Government may pursue the taxpayer's own property if it made a mistake the first time\").\n\nII\nAfter Elmer W. Cullers, Jr., and Dorothy Cullers established the EC Term of Years Trust in 1991, the IRS assessed federal tax liabilities against them for what the Government claimed (and the Trust does not dispute, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7) were unwarranted income tax deductions in the 1980s. The Government assumed that the Cullerses had transferred assets to the Trust to evade taxes, and so filed a tax lien against the Trust in August 1999. The Trust denied any obligation, but for the sake of preventing disruptive collection efforts by the IRS, it deposited funds in a bank account, against which the IRS issued a notice of levy to the bank in September 1999. In October, the bank responded with a check for over $3 million to the United States Treasury.\nAlmost a year after that, the Trust (joined by several other trusts created by the Cullerses) brought a civil action under 26 U.S.C. § 7426(a)(1) claiming wrongful levies, but the District Court dismissed it because the complaint was filed after the 9-month limitations period had expired, *1767 see § 6532(c)(1). The court also noted that tax-refund claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1) were not open to the plaintiff trusts because § 7426 \"`affords the exclusive remedy for an innocent third party whose property is confiscated by the IRS to satisfy another person's tax liability.'\" BSC Term of Years Trust v. United States, 2001-1 USTC ¶ 50,174, p. 87,237, n. 1, 87 AFTR 2d ¶ 2001-390, p.2001-547, n. 1, 2000 WL 33155870 (WD Tex., 2000) (quoting Texas Comm. Bank-Fort Worth, N.A. v. United States, 896 F.2d 152, 156 (C.A.5 1990); emphasis deleted). At first the Trust sought review by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, but then voluntarily dismissed its appeal. BSC Term of Years Trust v. United States, 87 AFTR 2d ¶ XXXX-XXXX, p.2001-2532 (2001).\nAfter unsuccessfully pursuing a tax refund at the administrative level, the Trust filed a second action, this one for a refund under § 1346(a)(1). The District Court remained of the view that a claim for a wrongful levy under § 7426(a)(1) had been the sole remedy possible and dismissed.[3] The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nBecause the Ninth Circuit, on the contrary, has held that § 7426(a)(1) is not the exclusive remedy for third parties challenging a levy, see WWSM Investors v. United States, 64 F.3d 456 (1995), we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S. Ct. 467, 166 L. Ed. 2d 333 (2006). We affirm.\n\nIII\n\"In a variety of contexts the Court has held that a precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts more general remedies.\" Brown v. GSA, 425 U.S. 820, 834, 96 S. Ct. 1961, 48 L. Ed. 2d 402 (1976); see Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461 U.S. 273, 284-286, 103 S. Ct. 1811, 75 L. Ed. 2d 840 (1983) (adverse claimants to real property of the United States may not rely on \"officer's suits\" or on other general remedies because the Quiet Title Act of 1972 is their exclusive recourse); see also Stonite Products Co. v. Melvin Lloyd Co., 315 U.S. 561, 62 S. Ct. 780, 86 L. Ed. 1026 (1942) (venue in patent infringement cases is governed by a statute dealing specifically with patents, not a general venue provision). It braces the preemption claim when resort to a general remedy would effectively extend the limitations period for the specific one. See Brown v. GSA, supra, at 833, 96 S. Ct. 1961 (rejecting an interpretation that would \"driv[e] out of currency\" a narrowly aimed provision \"with its rigorous ... time limitations\" by permitting \"access to the courts under other, less demanding statutes\"); see also Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122-123, 125 S. Ct. 1453, 161 L. Ed. 2d 316 (2005) (concluding that 47 U.S.C. § 332(c) precludes resort to the general cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in part because § 332 \"limits relief in ways that § 1983 does not\" by requiring judicial review to be sought within 30 days); 544 U.S., at 130, n., 125 S. Ct. 1453 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) (same).\nResisting the force of the better-fitted statute requires a good countervailing reason, and none appears here. Congress specifically tailored § 7426(a)(1) to third party claims of wrongful levy, and if third parties could avail themselves of the general tax refund jurisdiction of § 1346(a)(1), they could effortlessly evade the levy statute's 9-month limitations period thought *1768 essential to the Government's tax collection.\nThe Trust argues that in United States v. Williams, 514 U.S. 527, 115 S. Ct. 1611, 131 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1995), we construed the general jurisdictional grant of § 1346(a)(1) expansively enough to cover third parties' wrongful levy claims. So, according to the Trust, treating § 7426(a)(1) as the exclusive avenue for these claims would amount to a disfavored holding that § 7426(a)(1) implicitly repealed the pre-existing jurisdictional grant of § 1346(a)(1). See Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 96 S. Ct. 1989, 48 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1976); Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 94 S. Ct. 2474, 41 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1974).\nBut the Trust reads Williams too broadly. Although we decided that § 1346(a)(1) authorizes a tax-refund claim by a third party whose property was subjected to an allegedly wrongful tax lien, we so held on the specific understanding that no other remedy, not even a timely claim under § 7426(a)(1), was open to the plaintiff in that case. See Williams, supra, at 536-538, 115 S. Ct. 1611. Here, on the contrary, the Trust challenges a levy, not a lien, and could have made a timely claim under § 7426(a)(1) for the relief it now seeks under § 1346(a)(1).[4]\nAnd even if the canon against implied repeals applied here, the Trust still could not prevail. We simply cannot reconcile the 9-month limitations period for a wrongful levy claim under § 7426(a)(1) with the notion that the same challenge would be open under § 1346(a)(1) for up to four years. See Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U.S. 497, 503, 56 S. Ct. 349, 80 L. Ed. 351 (1936) (\"[W]here provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one\"). On this point, the Trust proposes that the two statutory schemes can be \"harmonized\" by construing the deadline for filing § 7426(a)(1) claims to cover only those actions seeking \"pre-deprivation\" remedies unavailable under § 1346(a)(1). See Reply Brief for Petitioner 6. But this reading would violate the clear text of § 7426(a)(1), which on its face applies to pre-deprivation and post-deprivation claims alike. See 26 U.S.C. § 7426(a)(1) (\"Such action may be brought without regard to whether such property has been surrendered to or sold by the Secretary\").\n\n\n*1769 * * *\nThe Trust missed the deadline for challenging a levy under § 7426(a)(1), and may not bring the challenge as a tax refund claim under § 1346(a)(1). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\nNOTES\n[1]  This period can be extended for up to 12 months if the third party makes an administrative request for the return of the property wrongfully levied upon. See 26 U.S.C. § 6532(c)(2).\n[2]  Title 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1) gives district courts \"jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims,\" over \"[a]ny civil action against the United States for the recovery of,\" among other things, \"any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.\" A taxpayer may bring such an action within two years after the IRS disallows the taxpayer's administrative refund claim. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 6532(a)(1)-(2); see also § 7422(a) (requiring a taxpayer to file the administrative claim before seeking a refund in court). An administrative refund claim must, in turn, be filed within two years from the date the tax was paid or three years from the time the tax return was filed, whichever is later. See § 6511(a).\n[3]  The District Court declined to dismiss the Trust's claim on res judicata grounds, and the Government does not argue claim or issue preclusion in this Court, see Brief for United States 5, n. 2.\n[4]  It has been commonly understood that Williams did not extend § 1346(a)(1) to parties in the Trust's position. See 434 F.3d 807, 810 (C.A.5 2006) (case below) (\"To construe Williams to allow an alternative remedy under § 1346, with its longer statute of limitations period, would undermine the surety provided by the clear avenue to recovery under § 7426\" (citation omitted)); Dahn v. United States, 127 F.3d 1249, 1253 (C.A.10 1997) (\"[T]here were no tax levies involved in [Williams]. Thus, the Court was concerned solely with the reach of § 1346 per se; the exclusivity of a concurrent § 7426 claim was never in issue. Indeed, the Court specifically emphasized the inapplicability of § 7426 (or any other meaningful remedy) to reinforce its broad reading of § 1346\"); WWSM Investors v. United States, 64 F.3d 456, 459 (C.A.9 1995) (Brunetti, J., dissenting) (\"The Supreme Court recognized Williams as a refund, not a wrongful levy, case, and [did not] even hint that § 7426 was not the exclusive remedy for a claimed wrongful levy\"); Rev. Rul.2005-49, 2005-2 Cum. Bull. 126 (\"The rationale in Williams is inapplicable to wrongful levy suits because Congress created an exclusive remedy under section 7426 for third persons claiming an interest in property levied upon by the [IRS]\"); but see WWSM Investors, supra, at 459 (majority opinion) (\"[S]eizing money from WWSM's bank account is functionally equivalent to what the IRS did in Williamsplacing a lien on property in escrow under circumstances which compelled Mrs. Williams to pay the IRS and discharge the lien\").\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

ANTONIO A. HINOJOSA\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 15–833    Decided May 16, 2016\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) requires a state prisoner seeking federal\nhabeas relief first to “exhaus[t] the remedies available in\nthe courts of the State.” 28 U.S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A). If the\nstate courts adjudicate the prisoner’s federal claim “on the\nmerits,” §2254(d), then AEDPA mandates deferential,\nrather than de novo, review, prohibiting federal courts\nfrom granting habeas relief unless the state-court decision\n“was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law,” §2254(d)(1), or “was\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts,”\n§2254(d)(2). The Ninth Circuit in this case decided that\nthe Supreme Court of California’s summary denial of a\nhabeas petition was not “on the merits,” and therefore\nAEDPA’s deferential-review provisions did not apply. We\nsummarily reverse.\n   Respondent Antonio Hinojosa was serving a 16-year\nsentence for armed robbery and related crimes when,\nin 2009, California prison officials “validated” him as a\nprison-gang associate and placed him in a secured housing\nunit. At the time of Hinojosa’s offense and conviction,\nCalifornia law had permitted prisoners placed in a secured\nhousing unit solely by virtue of their prison-gang affilia-\ntions to continue to accrue good-time credits. See Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. §2933.6 (West 2000). In 2010, the Cali-\nfornia Legislature amended the law so that prison-gang\n2                       KERNAN v. HINOJOSA\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nassociates placed in a secured housing unit could no longer\nearn future good-time credits, although they would retain\nany credits already earned. §2933.6(a) (West Supp. 2016).\n  Hinojosa filed a state habeas petition, arguing (as rele-\nvant here) that applying the new law to him violated the\nFederal Constitution’s prohibition of ex post facto laws.\nSee Art. I, §10, cl. 1; Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24\n(1981). The Orange County Superior Court denied the\nclaim “on grounds petitioner has not sought review of his\nclaim of error in the proper judicial venue.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 44a. The court explained:\n          “ ‘Although any superior court has jurisdiction to en-\n       tertain and adjudicate a petition for writ of habeas\n       corpus, it does not follow that it should do so in all in-\n       stances.’ Challenges to conditions of an inmate’s con-\n       finement should be entertained by the superior court\n       of county wherein the inmate is confined. (Griggs v.\n       Superior Court (1976) 16 Cal. 3d 341, 347.)\n          “The petition for writ of habeas corpus is DENIED.”\n       Id., at 44a–45a.1\n  Rather than file a new petition in the correct venue\n(Kings County Superior Court), Hinojosa turned to the\nappellate court, which summarily denied his petition.\nInstead of appealing that denial, see Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§1506 (West Supp. 2016), Hinojosa sought an original writ\nof habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of California, see\nCal. Const., Art. 6, §10, which summarily denied relief\n\n——————\n    1 InGriggs v. Superior Ct. of San Bernardino Cty., 16 Cal. 3d 341,\n347, 546 P.2d 727, 731 (1976), the Supreme Court of California stated\nthat “[a]s a general rule,” if a prisoner files a habeas petition challeng-\ning the conditions of his confinement in a county other than the one in\nwhich he is confined, the court should not deny the petition unless it\nfails to state a prima facie case. In this case, however, there is no hint\nin the opinion of the Superior Court that it followed this approach, and\npetitioner does not claim that it did.\n                 Cite as: 578 U. S. ____ (2016)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nwithout explanation.\n  A petition for federal habeas relief followed. Adopting\nthe Magistrate Judge’s findings and recommendation, the\nDistrict Court denied Hinojosa’s ex post facto claim under\nAEDPA’s deferential review. A Ninth Circuit panel re-\nversed. Hinojosa v. Davey, 803 F.3d 412 (2015). Citing\nour decision in Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797 (1991),\nthe panel “looked through” the Supreme Court of Califor-\nnia’s summary denial to the last reasoned decision adjudi-\ncating Hinojosa’s claim: the Superior Court’s dismissal for\nimproper venue. The panel reasoned that the Superior\nCourt’s decision “is not a determination ‘on the merits’ ”\nand that as a result it was “not bound by AEDPA.” 803\nF.3d, at 419. Having thus freed itself from AEDPA’s\nstrictures, the court granted Hinojosa’s petition for habeas\nrelief.\n  We reverse. In Ylst, we said that where “the last rea-\nsoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a procedural\ndefault, we will presume that a later decision rejecting the\nclaim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the\nmerits.” 501 U.S., at 803. We adopted this presumption\nbecause “silence implies consent, not the opposite—and\ncourts generally behave accordingly, affirming without\nfurther discussion when they agree, not when they disa-\ngree, with the reasons given below.” Id., at 804. But we\npointedly refused to make the presumption irrebuttable;\n“strong evidence can refute it.” Ibid.\n  It is amply refuted here. Improper venue could not\npossibly have been a ground for the high court’s summary\ndenial of Hinojosa’s claim. There is only one Supreme\nCourt of California—and thus only one venue in which\nHinojosa could have sought an original writ of habeas\ncorpus in that court. Under these circumstances, it cannot\nbe that the State Supreme Court’s denial “rest[ed] upon\nthe same ground” as the Superior Court’s. Id., at 803. It\nquite obviously rested upon some different ground. Ylst’s\n4                       KERNAN v. HINOJOSA\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\n“look-through” approach is therefore inapplicable.2\n   Hinojosa resists this conclusion, remarking that “a\nreviewing court has discretion to deny without prejudice a\nhabeas corpus petition that was not filed first in a proper\nlower court.” In re Steele, 32 Cal. 4th 682, 692, 85 P.3d\n444, 449 (2004) (emphasis added). But there is no indica-\ntion that the summary denial here was without prejudice,\nthus refuting Hinojosa’s speculation.\n   Containing no statement to the contrary, the Supreme\nCourt of California’s summary denial of Hinojosa’s petition\nwas therefore on the merits. Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU.S. 86, 99 (2011). Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit should\nhave reviewed Hinojosa’s ex post facto claim through\nAEDPA’s deferential lens. And although we express no\nview on the merits of that claim, we note that the Ninth\nCircuit has already held that state-court denials of claims\nidentical to Hinojosa’s are not contrary to clearly estab-\nlished federal law. See Nevarez v. Barnes, 749 F.3d 1124\n(CA9 2014); see also In re Efstathiou, 200 Cal. App. 4th\n725, 730–732, 133 Cal. Rptr. 3d 34, 37–40 (2011); In re\nSampson, 197 Cal. App. 4th 1234, 1240–1244, 130 Cal.\nRptr. 3d 39, 43–46 (2011). The panel below recognized as\nmuch: “If AEDPA applies here, we are bound by our deci-\nsion in Nevarez and must affirm the district court’s denial\nof Hinojosa’s petition.” 803 F.3d, at 418. AEDPA applies\nhere.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and Hinojosa’s mo-\ntion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted,\nand the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit is reversed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n——————\n   2 Alternatively, if the Superior Court in fact followed Griggs’ instruc-\n\ntions and silently concluded that the claim did not state a prima facie\ncase for relief, see n. 1, supra, the decision of the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia would still be a decision on the merits, and the AEDPA\nstandard of review would still apply.\n                 Cite as: 578 U.

HINOJOSA\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 15–833   Decided May 16, 2016\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG\njoins, dissenting.\n   When faced with a state-court order that denies a ha-\nbeas petition without explanation, this Court has long pre-\nsumed that the order agrees with the “last reasoned state-\ncourt opinion” in the case unless there is “strong evidence”\nto the contrary. Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 804–\n805 (1991). In this case, the parties agree that a Califor-\nnia Superior Court denied a petition for improper venue\nbecause it was filed in the wrong county. The California\nSupreme Court later denied the same petition for no ex-\nplained reason. Applying Ylst’s commonsense presump-\ntion, it is “most improbable” that the California Supreme\nCourt’s unexplained order disagreed with the Superior\nCourt’s reasoned order. Id., at 804. We should therefore\npresume that the California Supreme Court denied Anto-\nnio Hinojosa’s habeas petition because he filed the first\none in the wrong county.\n   The Court, however, believes there is strong evidence to\nthe contrary—for two inexplicable reasons. The first\nreason—the California Supreme Court could not have\ndenied the petition for “improper venue” because there is\nonly one California Supreme Court, ante, at 3—is a straw\nman, and a poorly constructed one at that. Obviously the\nCalifornia Supreme Court did not deny Hinojosa’s petition\nbecause he filed it in the wrong State Supreme Court. But\nit easily could have denied his petition because it agreed\n2                       KERNAN v. HINOJOSA\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwith the Superior Court’s conclusion that he filed the first\npetition in the wrong county. See In re Steele, 32 Cal. 4th\n682, 692, 85 P.3d 444, 449 (2004). That possibility be-\ncomes even more likely in light of California’s atypical\nhabeas rules, which treat an original habeas petition to\nthe California Supreme Court as the commonplace method\nfor seeking review of a lower court’s order. See Carey v.\nSaffold, 536 U.S. 214, 221–222 (2002).* By issuing a\nsilent order after reviewing the lower court’s reasoned\ndecision, the California Supreme Court presumably denied\nHinojosa’s petition on the same ground. Cf. Ylst, 501\nU.S., at 800 (applying its presumption on an identical\nposture out of California).\n   The majority’s second reason is even flimsier. The\nmajority suggests that the California Supreme Court’s\norder did not include the words “without prejudice” and\ntherefore could not have agreed with the Superior Court’s\ndenial—which the majority assumes was without preju-\ndice. Ante, at 4. But as the majority quotes, the Superior\nCourt simply “ ‘DENIED’ ” the petition; neither it nor the\nCalifornia Supreme Court “DENIED” it “without preju-\ndice.” Ante, at 2, 4. It is mindboggling how one opinion\nnecessarily disagrees with another opinion merely because\nit omits language that the other opinion also lacks.\n   I would hold, as the Ninth Circuit did, that the Califor-\nnia Supreme Court presumably agreed with the reasoning\nof the Superior Court. See Ylst, 501 U.S., at 804. At the\nvery least, I would not hold that there is such “strong\nevidence” to the contrary that we should summarily re-\nverse the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of the California\n——————\n  * Contrary to the majority’s characterization, Hinojosa did not file his\npetition “[i]nstead of appealing” the lower court’s denial, ante, at 2—his\npetition was itself his appeal. See Carey, 536 U.S., at 225 (calling an\noriginal habeas petition and the alternative “petition for hearing”\n“interchangeable” methods of appeal, “with neither option bringing\nadverse consequences to the petitioner”).\n                 Cite as: 578 U.

The Federal District Court dismissed the complaints because they failed to meet the \"heightened pleading standard\" adopted by the Court of Appeals, which requires that complaints against municipal corporations in § 1983 cases state with factual detail and particularity the basis for the claim.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\nHeld:  A federal court may not apply a \"heightened pleading standard\"—more stringent than the usual pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)—in civil rights cases alleging municipal liability under § 1983.  First, the heightened standard cannot be justified on the ground that a more relaxed pleading standard would eviscerate municipalities' immunity from suit by subjecting them to expensive and time-consuming discovery in every § 1983 case.  Municipalities, although free from respondeat superior liability under § 1983, see Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611, do not enjoy absolute or qualified immunity from § 1983 suits, id., at 701, 98 S.Ct., at 2041;  Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 650, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 1415, 63 L.Ed.2d 673.  Second, it is not possible to square the heightened standard applied in this case with the liberal system of \"notice pleading\" set up by the Federal Rules.  Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint include only \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\"  And while Rule 9(b) requires greater particularity in pleading certain actions, it does not include among the enumerated actions any reference to complaints alleging municipal liability under § 1983.

We hold it may not.\n\n\n2\nWe review here a decision granting a motion to dismiss, and therefore must accept as true all the factual allegations in the complaint.  See United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1267, ----, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991).  This action arose out of two separate incidents involving the execution of search warrants by local law enforcement officers.  Each involved the forcible entry into a home based on the detection of odors associated with the manufacture of narcotics.  One homeowner claimed that he was assaulted by the officers after they had entered;  another claimed that the police had entered her home in her absence and killed her two dogs.  Plaintiffs sued several local officials in their official capacity and the county and two municipal corporations that employed the police officers involved in the incidents, asserting that the police conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The stated basis for municipal liability under Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), was the failure of these bodies adequately to train the police officers involved.  See Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989).\n\n\n3\nThe United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas ordered the complaints dismissed, because they failed to meet the \"heightened pleading standard\" required by the decisional law of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  755 F.Supp. 726 (1991).  The Fifth Circuit, in turn, affirmed the judgment of dismissal, 954 F.2d 1054 (1992), and we granted certiorari, 505 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2989, 120 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals concerning the applicability of a heightened pleading standard to § 1983 actions alleging municipal liability.  Compare, e.g., Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 839 F.2d 621, 624 (CA9 1988) (\"a claim of municipal liability under section 1983 is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss even if the claim is based on nothing more than a bare allegation that the individual officers' conduct conformed to official policy, custom, or practice\") (internal quotation marks omitted).  We now reverse.\n\n\n4\nRespondents seek to defend the Fifth Circuit's application of a more rigorous pleading standard on two grounds.**  First, respondents claim that municipalities' freedom from respondeat superior liability, see Monell, supra, necessarily includes immunity from suit.  In this sense, respondents assert, municipalities are no different from state or local officials sued in their individual capacity.  Respondents reason that a more relaxed pleading requirement would subject municipalities to expensive and time consuming discovery in every § 1983 case, eviscerating their immunity from suit and disrupting municipal functions.\n\n\n5\nThis argument wrongly equates freedom from liability with immunity from suit.  To be sure, we reaffirmed in Monell that \"a municipality cannot be held liable under § 1983 on a respondeat superior theory.\"  436 U.S., at 691, 98 S.Ct., at 2036.  But, contrary to respondents' assertions, this protection against liability does not encompass immunity from suit.  Indeed, this argument is flatly contradicted by Monell and our later decisions involving municipal liability under § 1983.  In Monell, we overruled Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), insofar as it held that local governments were wholly immune from suit under § 1983, though we did reserve decision on whether municipalities are entitled to some form of limited immunity.  436 U.S., at 701, 98 S.Ct., at 2041.  Yet, when we took that issue up again in Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 650, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 1415, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980), we rejected a claim that municipalities should be afforded qualified immunity, much like that afforded individual officials, based on the good faith of their agents.  These decisions make it quite clear that, unlike various government officials, municipalities do not enjoy immunity from suit—either absolute or qualified —under § 1983.  In short, a municipality can be sued under § 1983, but it cannot be held liable unless a municipal policy or custom caused the constitutional injury.  We thus have no occasion to consider whether our qualified immunity jurisprudence would require a heightened pleading in cases involving individual government officials.\n\n\n6\nSecond, respondents contend that the Fifth Circuit's heightened pleading standard is not really that at all.  See Brief for Respondents Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit et al. 9-10 (\"[T]he Fifth Circuit's so-called 'heightened' pleading requirement is a misnomer\").  According to respondents, the degree of factual specificity required of a complaint by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure varies according to the complexity of the underlying substantive law.  To establish municipal liability under § 1983, respondents argue, a plaintiff must do more than plead a single instance of misconduct.  This requirement, respondents insist, is consistent with a plaintiff's Rule 11 obligation to make a reasonable pre-filing inquiry into the facts.\n\n\n7\nBut examination of the Fifth Circuit's decision in this case makes it quite evident that the \"heightened pleading standard\" is just what it purports to be:  a more demanding rule for pleading a complaint under § 1983 than for pleading other kinds of claims for relief.  See 954 F.2d, at 1057-1058.  This rule was adopted by the Fifth Circuit in Elliott v. Perez, 751 F.2d 1472 (1985), and described in this language:\n\n\n8\n\"In cases against government officials involving the likely      defense of immunity we require of trial judges that they      demand that the plaintiff's complaints state with factual      detail and particularity the basis for the claim which      necessarily includes why the defendant-official cannot      successfully maintain the defense of immunity.\"  Id., at      1473.\n\n\n9\nIn later cases, the Fifth Circuit extended this rule to complaints against municipal corporations asserting liability under § 1983.  See, e.g., Palmer v. San Antonio, 810 F.2d 514 (1987).\n\n\n10\nWe think that it is impossible to square the \"heightened pleading standard\" applied by the Fifth Circuit in this case with the liberal system of \"notice pleading\" set up by the Federal Rules.  Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint include only \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\"  In Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), we said in effect that the Rule meant what it said:\n\n\n11\n\"[T]he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a      claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases      his claim.  To the contrary, all the Rules require is 'a      short and plain statement of the claim' that will give the      defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and      the grounds upon which it rests.\"  Id., at 47, 78 S.Ct., at      103 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n12\nRule 9(b) does impose a particularity requirement in two specific instances.  It provides that \"[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\"  Thus, the Federal Rules do address in Rule 9(b) the question of the need for greater particularity in pleading certain actions, but do not include among the enumerated actions any reference to complaints alleging municipal liability under § 1983.  Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.\n\n\n13\nThe phenomenon of litigation against municipal corporations based on claimed constitutional violations by their employees dates from our decision in Monell, supra, where we for the first time construed § 1983 to allow such municipal liability.  Perhaps if Rules 8 and 9 were rewritten today, claims against municipalities under § 1983 might be subjected to the added specificity requirement of Rule 9(b).  But that is a result which must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.  In the absence of such an amendment, federal courts and litigants must rely on summary judgment and control of discovery to weed out unmeritorious claims sooner rather than later.\n\n\n14\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n15\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.  See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.\n\n\n**\n Respondents also argue that certain claims are barred by collateral estoppel.  According to respondents, petitioners brought an unsuccessful civil rights action against two of the police officers who allegedly were involved in one of the incidents.  Petitioners respond that the adverse ruling in this other litigation is currently on appeal and thus is not final for collateral estoppel purposes.  Because this issue was neither addressed by the Fifth Circuit nor included in the questions presented, we will not consider it.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Ct. 1989 (2007)\nLOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, et al.\nv.\nMax RETTELE et al.\nNo. 06-605.\nSupreme Court of United States.\nDecided May 21, 2007.\n*1990 PER CURIAM.\nDeputies of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department obtained a valid warrant to search a house, but they were unaware that the suspects being sought had moved out three months earlier. When the deputies searched the house, they found in a bedroom two residents who were of a different race than the suspects. The deputies ordered these innocent residents, who had been sleeping unclothed, out of bed. The deputies required them to stand for a few minutes before allowing them to dress.\nThe residents brought suit under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, naming the deputies and other parties and accusing them of violating the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The District Court granted summary judgment to all named defendants. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding both that the deputies violated the Fourth Amendment and that they were not entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable deputy would have stopped the search upon discovering that respondents were of a different race than the suspects and because a reasonable deputy would not have ordered respondents from their bed. We grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals by this summary disposition.\n\nI\nFrom September to December 2001, Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department Deputy Dennis Watters investigated a fraud and identity-theft crime ring. There were four suspects of the investigation. One had registered a 9-millimeter Glock handgun. The four suspects were known to be African-Americans.\nOn December 11, Watters obtained a search warrant for two houses in Lancaster, California, where he believed he could find the suspects. The warrant authorized *1991 him to search the homes and three of the suspects for documents and computer files. In support of the search warrant an affidavit cited various sources showing the suspects resided at respondents' home. The sources included Department of Motor Vehicles reports, mailing address listings, an outstanding warrant, and an Internet telephone directory. In this Court respondents do not dispute the validity of the warrant or the means by which it was obtained.\nWhat Watters did not know was that one of the houses (the first to be searched) had been sold in September to a Max Rettele. He had purchased the home and moved into it three months earlier with his girlfriend Judy Sadler and Sadler's 17-year-old son Chase Hall. All three, respondents here, are Caucasians.\nOn the morning of December 19, Watters briefed six other deputies in preparation for the search of the houses. Watters informed them they would be searching for three African-American suspects, one of whom owned a registered handgun. The possibility a suspect would be armed caused the deputies concern for their own safety. Watters had not obtained special permission for a night search, so he could not execute the warrant until 7 a.m. See Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 1533 (West 2000). Around 7:15 Watters and six other deputies knocked on the door and announced their presence. Chase Hall answered. The deputies entered the house after ordering Hall to lie face down on the ground.\nThe deputies' announcement awoke Rettele and Sadler. The deputies entered their bedroom with guns drawn and ordered them to get out of their bed and to show their hands. They protested that they were not wearing clothes. Rettele stood up and attempted to put on a pair of sweatpants, but deputies told him not to move. Sadler also stood up and attempted, without success, to cover herself with a sheet. Rettele and Sadler were held at gunpoint for one to two minutes before Rettele was allowed to retrieve a robe for Sadler. He was then permitted to dress. Rettele and Sadler left the bedroom within three to four minutes to sit on the couch in the living room.\nBy that time the deputies realized they had made a mistake. They apologized to Rettele and Sadler, thanked them for not becoming upset, and left within five minutes. They proceeded to the other house the warrant authorized them to search, where they found three suspects. Those suspects were arrested and convicted.\nRettele and Sadler, individually and as guardians ad litem for Hall, filed this § 1983 suit against Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Deputy Watters, and other members of the sheriff's department. Respondents alleged petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment rights by obtaining a warrant in reckless fashion and conducting an unreasonable search and detention. The District Court held that the warrant was obtained by proper procedures and the search was reasonable. It concluded in the alternative that any Fourth Amendment rights the deputies violated were not clearly established and that, as a result, the deputies were entitled to qualified immunity.\nOn appeal respondents did not challenge the validity of the warrant; they did argue that the deputies had conducted the search in an unreasonable manner. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in an unpublished opinion. 186 Fed.Appx. 765 (2006). The majority held that\n\"because (1) no African-Americans lived in [respondents'] home; (2) [respondents], a Caucasian couple, purchased the residence several months before the *1992 search and the deputies did not conduct an ownership inquiry; (3) the African-American suspects were not accused of a crime that required an emergency search; and (4) [respondents] were ordered out of bed naked and held at gunpoint while the deputies searched their bedroom for the suspects and a gun, we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that the search and detention were `unnecessarily painful, degrading, or prolonged,' and involved `an undue invasion of privacy,' Franklin v. Foxworth, 31 F.3d 873, 876 (9th Cir.1994).\" Id., at 766.\nTurning to whether respondents' Fourth Amendment rights were clearly established, the majority held that a reasonable deputy should have known the search and detention were unlawful.\nJudge Cowen dissented. In his view the deputies had authority to detain respondents for the duration of the search and were justified in ordering respondents from their bed because weapons could have been concealed under the bedcovers. He also concluded that, assuming a constitutional violation, the law was not clearly established.\nThe Court of Appeals denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.\n\nII\nBecause respondents were of a different race than the suspects the deputies were seeking, the Court of Appeals held that \"[a]fter taking one look at [respondents], the deputies should have realized that [respondents] were not the subjects of the search warrant and did not pose a threat to the deputies' safety.\" Ibid. We need not pause long in rejecting this unsound proposition. When the deputies ordered respondents from their bed, they had no way of knowing whether the African-American suspects were elsewhere in the house. The presence of some Caucasians in the residence did not eliminate the possibility that the suspects lived there as well. As the deputies stated in their affidavits, it is not uncommon in our society for people of different races to live together. Just as people of different races live and work together, so too might they engage in joint criminal activity. The deputies, who were searching a house where they believed a suspect might be armed, possessed authority to secure the premises before deciding whether to continue with the search.\nIn Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 101 S. Ct. 2587, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1981), this Court held that officers executing a search warrant for contraband may \"detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.\" Id., at 705, 101 S. Ct. 2587. In weighing whether the search in Summers was reasonable the Court first found that \"detention represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant.\" Id., at 703, 101 S. Ct. 2587. Against that interest, it balanced \"preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found\"; \"minimizing the risk of harm to the officers\"; and facilitating \"the orderly completion of the search.\" Id., at 702-703, 101 S. Ct. 2587; see Muehler v. Mena, 544 U.S. 93, 125 S. Ct. 1465, 161 L. Ed. 2d 299 (2005).\nIn executing a search warrant officers may take reasonable action to secure the premises and to ensure their own safety and the efficacy of the search. Id., at 98-100, 125 S. Ct. 1465; see also id., at 103, 125 S. Ct. 1465 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); Summers, supra, at 704-705, 101 S. Ct. 2587. The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is an objective one. Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1989) (addressing the reasonableness of a *1993 seizure of the person). Unreasonable actions include the use of excessive force or restraints that cause unnecessary pain or are imposed for a prolonged and unnecessary period of time. Mena, supra, at 100, 125 S. Ct. 1465; Graham, supra, at 396-399, 109 S. Ct. 1865.\nThe orders by the police to the occupants, in the context of this lawful search, were permissible, and perhaps necessary, to protect the safety of the deputies. Blankets and bedding can conceal a weapon, and one of the suspects was known to own a firearm, factors which underscore this point. The Constitution does not require an officer to ignore the possibility that an armed suspect may sleep with a weapon within reach. The reports are replete with accounts of suspects sleeping close to weapons. See United States v. Enslin, 327 F.3d 788, 791 (C.A.9 2003) (\"When [the suspect] put his hands in the air and began to sit up, his movement shifted the covers and the marshals could see a gun in the bed next to him\"); see also United States v. Jones, 336 F.3d 245, 248 (C.A.3 2003) (suspect kept a 9-millimeter Luger under his pillow while he slept); United States v. Hightower, 96 F.3d 211 (C.A.7 1996) (suspect kept a loaded five-shot handgun under his pillow); State v. Willis, 36,759-KA, p. 3 (La.App.4/9/03), 843 So. 2d 592, 595 (officers \"pulled back the bed covers and found a .38 caliber Model 10 Smith and Wesson revolver located near where defendant's left hand had been\"); State v. Kypreos, 115 Wash.App. 207, 61 P.3d 352 (2002) (suspect kept a handgun in the bed).\nThe deputies needed a moment to secure the room and ensure that other persons were not close by or did not present a danger. Deputies were not required to turn their backs to allow Rettele and Sadler to retrieve clothing or to cover themselves with the sheets. Rather, \"[t]he risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.\" Summers, 452 U.S., at 702-703, 101 S. Ct. 2587.\nThis is not to say, of course, that the deputies were free to force Rettele and Sadler to remain motionless and standing for any longer than necessary. We have recognized that \"special circumstances, or possibly a prolonged detention\" might render a search unreasonable. See id., at 705, n. 21, 101 S. Ct. 2587. There is no accusation that the detention here was prolonged. The deputies left the home less than 15 minutes after arriving. The detention was shorter and less restrictive than the 2- to 3-hour handcuff detention upheld in Mena. See 544 U.S., at 100, 125 S. Ct. 1465. And there is no allegation that the deputies prevented Sadler and Rettele from dressing longer than necessary to protect their safety. Sadler was unclothed for no more than two minutes, and Rettele for only slightly more time than that. Sadler testified that once the police were satisfied that no immediate threat was presented, \"they wanted us to get dressed and they were pressing us really fast to hurry up and get some clothes on.\" Deposition of Judy Lorraine Sadler in No. CV-0206262-RSWL (RNBX) (CD Cal., June 10, 2003), Doc. 26, Exh. 4, p. 55.\nThe Fourth Amendment allows warrants to issue on probable cause, a standard well short of absolute certainty. Valid warrants will issue to search the innocent, and people like Rettele and Sadler unfortunately bear the cost. Officers executing search warrants on occasion enter a house when residents are engaged in private activity; and the resulting frustration, embarrassment, and humiliation may be real, as was true here. When officers execute a valid warrant and act in a reasonable manner to protect themselves *1994 from harm, however, the Fourth Amendment is not violated.\nAs respondents' constitutional rights were not violated, \"there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S. Ct. 3151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nJustice SOUTER would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.\nJustice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, concurring in the judgment.\nThis case presents two separate questions: (1) whether the four circumstances identified in the Court of Appeals' unpublished opinion established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the seizure violated respondents' Fourth Amendment rights, see ante, at 1991-1992; (2) whether the officers were nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity because the right was not clearly established. The fact that the judges on the Court of Appeals disagreed on both questions convinces me that they should not have announced their decision in an unpublished opinion.\nIn answering the first question, the Ninth Circuit majority relied primarily on Franklin v. Foxworth, 31 F.3d 873 (C.A.9 1994). As Judge Cowen's discussion of Franklin demonstrates, that case surely does not clearly establish the unconstitutionality of the officers' conduct.[*] Consequently, regardless of the proper answer to the constitutional question, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. I would reverse on that ground and disavow the unwise practice of deciding constitutional questions in advance of the necessity for doing so. See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 859, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment.\nNOTES\n[*]  See 186 Fed.Appx. 765, 767 (2006) (dissenting opinion) (\"In Franklin v. Foxworth, 31 F.3d 873 (9th Cir.1994), we found unconstitutional the officers' failure to provide clothing to a gravely ill man before exposing his genitals to twenty-three strangers for over two hours, under circumstances where there was no reason why the man was not given clothing. Id. at 876-78. We concluded that the detention was conducted in `a manner that wantonly and callously subjected an obviously ill and incapacitated person to entirely unnecessary and unjustifiable degradation and suffering.' Id. at 878. Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs were not gravely ill, and their brief exposure, which lasted, at most, three or four minutes, was outweighed by the safety risks associated with allowing two occupants to remain in bed under covers during execution of a search warrant\").\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

NETHERLAND, Warden.\nNo. 95-6016.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nOct. 30, 1995.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nIn Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 77 L.Ed.2d 235 (1983), we held that a death sentence supported by multiple aggravating circumstances need not always be set aside if one aggravator is found to be invalid.  Id., at 886-888, 103 S.Ct., at 2747-2749.  We noted that our holding did not apply in States in which the jury is instructed to weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating circumstances in determining whether to impose the death penalty.  Id., at 874, n. 12, 890, 103 S.Ct., at 2741, n. 12, 2749.  In this case, the Virginia Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit construed Zant as establishing a rule that in nonweighing States a death sentence may be upheld on the basis of one valid aggravating circumstance, regardless of the reasons for which another aggravating factor may have been found to be invalid.  Because this interpretation of our holding in Zant is incorrect, we now grant the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n2\n* Petitioner Tuggle was convicted of murder in Virginia state court.  At his sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth presented unrebutted psychiatric testimony that petitioner demonstrated \" 'a high probability of future dangerousness.' \"  Tuggle v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 99, 107, 334 S.E.2d 838, 844 (1985), cert. denied, Tuggle v. Virginia, 478 U.S. 1010, 106 S.Ct. 3309, 92 L.Ed.2d 722 (1986).  After deliberations, the jury found that the Commonwealth had established Virginia's two statutory aggravating circumstances, \"future dangerousness\" and \"vileness\";  it exercised its discretion to sentence petitioner to death.1  230 Va., at 108-109, 334 S.E.2d, at 844-845.\n\n\n3\nShortly after the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence, Tuggle v.  Commonwealth, 228 Va. 493, 323 S.E.2d 539 (1984), we held in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985), that when the prosecutor presents psychiatric evidence of an indigent defendant's future dangerousness in a capital sentencing proceeding, due process requires that the State provide the defendant with the assistance of an independent psychiatrist. Id., at 83-84, 105 S.Ct., at 1096-1097.  Because petitioner had been denied such assistance, we vacated the State Supreme Court's judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of Ake. Tuggle v. Virginia, 471 U.S. 1096, 105 S.Ct. 2315, 85 L.Ed.2d 835 (1985).\n\n\n4\nOn remand, the Virginia Supreme Court invalidated the future dangerousness aggravating circumstance because of the Ake error. See Tuggle v. Commonwealth, 230 Va., at 108-111, 334 S.E.2d, at 844-846.  The court nevertheless reaffirmed petitioner's death sentence, reasoning that Zant permitted the sentence to survive on the basis of the vileness aggravator.  Id., at 110-111, 334 S.E.2d, at 845-846.  The Court of Appeals agreed with this analysis on federal habeas review, Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F.3d 1356, 1362-1363 (C.A.4 1995), as it had in the past.2  Quoting the Virginia Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals stated:\n\n\n5\n\" 'When a jury makes separate findings of specific statutory      aggravating circumstances, any of which could support a      sentence of death, and one of the circumstances subsequently      is invalidated, the remaining valid circumstance, or      circumstances, will support the sentence.' \"  Id., at 1363      (quoting 230 Va., at 110, 334 S.E.2d, at 845  and citing      Zant, supra ).\n\nII\n\n6\nOur opinion in Zant stressed that the evidence offered to prove the invalid aggravator was \"properly adduced at the sentencing hearing and was fully subject to explanation by the defendant.\"  462 U.S., at 887, 103 S.Ct., at 2748.  As we explained:\n\n\n7\n\"[I]t is essential to keep in mind the sense in which [the      stricken] aggravating circumstance is 'invalid.'  . . . [T]he      invalid aggravating circumstance found by the jury in this      case was struck down . . . because the Georgia Supreme Court      concluded that it fails to provide an adequate basis for      distinguishing a murder case in which the death penalty may      be imposed from those cases in which such a penalty may not      be imposed.  The underlying evidence is nevertheless fully      admissible at the sentencing phase.\"  Id., at 885-886, 103      S.Ct., at 2747 (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n8\nZant was thus predicated on the fact that even after elimination of the invalid aggravator, the death sentence rested on firm ground.  Two unimpeachable aggravating factors remained and there was no claim that inadmissible evidence was before the jury during its sentencing deliberations or that the defendant had been precluded from adducing relevant mitigating evidence.\n\n\n9\nIn this case, the record does not provide comparable support for petitioner's death sentence.  The Ake error prevented petitioner from developing his own psychiatric evidence to rebut the Commonwealth's evidence and to enhance his defense in mitigation.  As a result, the Commonwealth's psychiatric evidence went unchallenged, which may have unfairly increased its persuasiveness in the eyes of the jury.  We may assume, as the Virginia Supreme Court and Court of Appeals found, that petitioner's psychiatric evidence would not have influenced the jury's determination concerning vileness.  Nevertheless, the absence of such evidence may well have affected the jury's ultimate decision, based on all of the evidence before it, to sentence petitioner to death rather than life imprisonment.\n\n\n10\nAlthough our holding in Zant supports the conclusion that the invalidation of one aggravator does not necessarily require that a death sentence be set aside, that holding does not support the quite different proposition that the existence of a valid aggravator always ex cuses a constitutional error in the admission or exclusion of evidence.  The latter circumstance is more akin to the situation in Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U.S. 578, 108 S.Ct. 1981, 100 L.Ed.2d 575 (1988), in which we held that Zant does not apply to support a death sentence imposed by a jury that was allowed to consider materially inaccurate evidence, id., at 590, 108 S.Ct., at 1988, than to Zant itself.  Because the Court of Appeals misapplied Zant in this case, its judgment must be vacated.\n\nIII\n\n11\nHaving found no need to remedy the Ake error in petitioner's sentencing, the Virginia Supreme Court did not consider whether, or by what procedures, the sentence might be sustained or reimposed;  and neither the state court nor the Court of Appeals addressed whether harmless-error analysis is applicable to this case.  Because this Court customarily does not address such an issue in the first instance, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n12\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n13\nJustice SCALIA, concurring.\n\n\n14\nThis is a simple case and should be simply resolved.  The jury that deliberated on petitioner's sentence had before it evidence that should have been excluded in light of Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985).  The Virginia Supreme Court so concluded (in an opinion that is not before us) and, having so concluded, was obliged to determine whether there was reasonable doubt as to whether the constitutional error contributed to the jury's decision to impose the sentence of death.  Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U.S. 249, 256, 108 S.Ct. 1792, 1797, 100 L.Ed.2d 284 (1988).  Because it failed to perform that task, the habeas judgment at issue here cannot stand, and a remand is appropriate to allow the Fourth Circuit to review the case under the harmless-error standard appropriate to collateral review.   Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1716, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).\n\n\n15\nWhen these proceedings were before the Virginia Supreme Court after our first remand, petitioner managed to transform the simple question arising from the admission of constitutionally impermissible evidence (\"might the constitutional error have affected the decision of the capital sentencing jury?\") into a question of seemingly greater moment (\"can a death sentence based in part on an 'invalid aggravating circumstance' still stand?\"). The Virginia Supreme Court answered the second question, the wrong question, perhaps because it assumed that that could easily be resolved by reference to Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 77 L.Ed.2d 235 (1983);  and on federal habeas, the District Court and the Fourth Circuit understandably focused upon the consequences of the Virginia Supreme Court's position that the \"future dangerousness\" aggravating circumstance was rendered \"invalid\" by the Ake error.  The Court correctly demonstrates why Zant is not applicable here, but regrettably follows the Virginia Supreme Court and the courts below in failing to strip the \"invalid aggravating circumstance\" camouflage that petitioner has added to a straightforward inadmissible-evidence case.\n\n\n\n1\n Virginia's capital punishment statute involves a two-stage determination.  The jury first decides whether the prosecutor has established one or both of the statutory aggravating factors. Va.Code Ann. § 19.2-264.4(C)-(D) (1995).  If the jury finds neither aggravator satisfied, it must impose a sentence of life imprisonment.  Ibid.  If the jury find one or both of the aggravators established, however, it has full discretion to impose either a death sentence or a sentence of life imprisonment.  Ibid.\n\n\n2\n See Smith v.

He had previously brought that claim in a state petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, but the County Superior Court found it waived under Rule 32.2(a)(3) because he had not raised it in two previous Rule 32 petitions. The Federal District Court concluded that the state court's ruling barred federal habeas relief, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that the state procedural default was not independent of federal law and thus did not bar federal review. This Court granted certiorari and certified to the Arizona Supreme Court a question concerning Rule 32.2(a)(3)'s proper interpretation. The latter court responded that, at the time of respondent's state petition, the question whether an asserted claim was of sufficient constitutional magnitude to require a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver for purposes of the Rule depended not upon the merits of the particular claim but upon the particular right alleged to have been violated.\nHeld: The District Court properly refused to review respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The Arizona Supreme Court's reply makes clear that Rule 32.2(a)(3) only requires courts to categorize a claim, not to evaluate the claim's merits. When resolution of a state procedural law question depends on a federal constitutional ruling, the state-law prong of the court's holding is not independent of federal law and this Court's direct review jurisdiction is not precluded. Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75. Assuming that the same standard governs the scope of a district court's power to grant federal habeas relief, Rule 32.2(a)(3) determinations are independent of federal law because they do not depend upon a constitutional ruling on the merits. Although the state court's decision would not be independent of federal law if it rested primarily on a ruling on the merits, the record here reveals no such ruling.\n241 F. 3d 1191, reversed and remanded.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nAt issue in this case is whether, when an Arizona Superior Court denied respondent's successive petition for state post-conviction relief because respondent had failed to comply with Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(a)(3) (West 2000), the state court's ruling was independent of federal law. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit thought not. We granted certiorari and certified to the Arizona Supreme Court a question concerning the proper interpretation of Rule 32.2(a)(3). We have received a response and now reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision.\n\n\n2\n* Respondent, Robert Douglas Smith, was convicted in Arizona in 1982 of first-degree murder, kidnaping, and sexual assault. He was sentenced to death on the murder count and to consecutive 21-year prison terms on the other counts. After a series of unsuccessful petitions for state postconviction relief, respondent filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. §§ 2241 and 2254 in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The petition alleged, among other things, that respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated because his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance during the sentencing phase of his trial.\n\n\n3\nRespondent had previously brought this ineffective-assistance claim in a 1995 petition for state postconviction relief pursuant to Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32. The Pima County Superior Court denied the claim, finding it waived under Rule 32.2(a)(3) because respondent had failed to raise it in two previous Rule 32 petitions. The state court rejected respondent's contention that his procedural default was excused because his appellate and Rule 32 attorneys suffered from a conflict of interest between their responsibility toward respondent and their allegiance to the Public Defender's office, of which respondent's trial counsel was also a member.\n\n\n4\nThe District Court relied on the Pima County Superior Court's procedural ruling on respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim to bar federal habeas relief. Like the state court, the District Court rejected respondent's argument that his appellate and Rule 32 counsel suffered from a conflict of interest which excused his procedural default. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that although the state court's procedural default ruling was regularly followed and therefore adequate, see 241 F. 3d 1191, 1195, n. 2 (2001) (citing Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S. 578, 587 (1988)), the ruling required consideration of the merits of respondent's claim and was therefore not independent of federal law, see 241 F. 3d, at 1196-1197. Rule 32.2(a)(3) applies different standards for waiver depending on whether the claim asserted in a Rule 32 petition is of \"sufficient constitutional magnitude.\" If it is, the rule requires that the waiver be \"knowin[g], voluntar[y] and intelligen[t],\" not merely omitted from previous petitions. Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3), comment (West 2000). The Ninth Circuit opined that, at the time the state court ruled on respondent's ineffective-assistance claim, the determination of whether a claim is of sufficient magnitude required consideration of the merits of the claim. See 241 F. 3d, at 1197 (citing State v. French, 198 Ariz. 119, 121, 7 P. 3d 128, 130 (App. 2000); State v. Curtis, 185 Ariz. 112, 115, 912 P. 2d 1341, 1344 (App. 1995)). The Ninth Circuit concluded that, under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75 (1985), the state court's ruling did not bar federal review of the merits of respondent's claim. See 241 F. 3d, at 1196-1197. We granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision. 534 U. S. 157 (2001) (per curiam).\n\nII\n\n5\nBecause we were uncertain about the proper interpretation of Rule 32.2(a)(3), we certified the following question to the Arizona Supreme Court:\n\n\n6\n\"At the time of respondent's third Rule 32 petition in 1995, did the question whether an asserted claim was of `sufficient constitutional magnitude' to require a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver for purposes of Rule 32.2(a)(3), see Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3), comment (West 2000), depend upon the merits of the particular claim, see State v. French, 198 Ariz. 119, 121-122, 7 P. 3d 128, 130-131 (App. 2000); State v. Curtis, 185 Ariz. App. 112, 115, 912 P. 2d 1341, 1344 (1995), or merely upon the particular right alleged to have been violated, see State v. Espinosa, 200 Ariz. 503, 505, 29 P. 3d 278, 280 (App. 2001)?\" 534 U. S., at 159.\n\nWe received the following reply:\n\n7\n\"We hold that at the time of respondent's third Rule 32 petition in 1995, the question whether an asserted claim was of `sufficient constitutional magnitude' to require a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver for purposes of Rule 32.2(a)(3), see Comment to 32.2(a)(3), depended not upon the merits of the particular claim, but rather merely upon the particular right alleged to have been violated.\" Stewart v. Smith, 202 Ariz. 446, 447, 46 P. 3d 1067, 1068 (2002) (en banc).\n\n\n8\nThe Arizona Supreme Court's reply makes clear that Rule 32.2(a)(3) does not require courts to evaluate the merits of a particular claim, but only to categorize the claim. According to the Arizona Supreme Court, courts must evaluate whether \"at its core, [a] claim implicates a significant right that requires a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver.\" Id., at 450, 46 P. 3d, at 1071. Courts need not decide the merits of the claim, i. e., whether the right was actually violated. They need only identify what type of claim it is, and there is no indication that this identification is based on an interpretation of what federal law requires. See Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 652-653 (1979).\n\n\n9\nOur cases make clear that \"when resolution of [a] state procedural law question depends on a federal constitutional ruling, the state-law prong of the court's holding is not independent of federal law, and our [direct review] jurisdiction is not precluded.\" Ake, supra, at 75. Even assuming that the same standard governs the scope of a district court's power to grant federal habeas relief as governs this Court's jurisdiction to review a state-court judgment on direct review, see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729-732, 741 (1991), Rule 32.2(a)(3) determinations are independent of federal law because they do not depend upon a federal constitutional ruling on the merits. The District Court properly refused to review respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding otherwise.\n\n\n10\nEven though Rule 32.2(a)(3) does not require a federal constitutional ruling on the merits, if the state court's decision rested primarily on a ruling on the merits nevertheless, its decision would not be independent of federal law. The Ninth Circuit interpreted the state court's order rejecting respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim as possibly resting on a ruling on the merits of the claim. The record, however, reveals no such ruling.\n\n\n11\nThe state court did not even reach the merits of respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, finding it waived because respondent had failed to raise it in prior petitions for postconviction relief. As an excuse, respondent asserted that his prior appellate and Rule 32 counsel, who were members of the Arizona Public Defender's office, had refused to file the claim because his trial counsel was also a member of the Public Defender's office. The state court did not find this excuse sufficient to overcome respondent's procedural default. See App. H to Pet. for Cert. The state court explained that, because deputies in the Public Defender's office represent their clients and not their office, respondent's appellate lawyers would never have allowed \"a colorable claim for ineffective assistance of counsel\" to go unstated. Id., at 2. The Ninth Circuit read the reference to a \"colorable claim\" as a conclusion that respondent's claim that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance lacked merit, that is, as a comment on the merits of respondent's underlying claim. 241 F. 3d, at 1197. In context, however, it is clear that the reference to \"colorable claim\" was used only as a rhetorical device for emphasizing the lack of any conflict of interest that might excuse respondent's waiver.\n\n\n12\nBecause the state court's determination that respondent waived his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim under Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3) did not require an examination of the merits of that claim, it was independent of federal law. We voice no opinion on whether respondent has provided valid cause to overcome his procedural default in state court. The Ninth Circuit's judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n13\n\nSo ordered.\nChoices:\n(A) 1, Criminal Procedure\n(B) 2, Civil Rights\n(C) 3, First Amendment\n(D) 4, Due Process\n(E) 5, Privacy\n(F) 6, Attorneys\n(G) 7, Unions\n(H) 8, Economic Activity\n(I) 9, Judicial Power\n(J) 10, Federalism\n(K) 11, Interstate Relations\n(L) 12, Federal Taxation\n(M) 13, Miscellaneous\n(N) 14, Private Action\nAnswer:"

Karlan argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the briefs were Thomas C. Goldstein, Amy Howe, and Kevin K. Russell.\nMalcolm L. Stewart argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Clement, Assistant Attorney General Keisler, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler, John P. Elwood, William Kanter, Jeffrey A. *513 Rosen, Paul M. Geier, Jerome M. Mellody, Mark A. Robbins, Steven E. Abow, and Robin M. Richardson.[*]\nPER CURIAM.\nTerry Whitman, the petitioner, is an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is subject to the agency's drug and alcohol testing program. Without first seeking to pursue grievance procedures under his collective-bargaining agreement, he filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, alleging the FAA tested him in a nonrandom manner, in violation of his constitutional rights and 49 U.S. C. § 45104(8).\nThe FAA has its own procedural framework for the resolution of claims by its employees; and for this purpose it adopts certain sections of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), including Chapter 71 of Title 5, which sets forth the rules for grievances. 49 U.S. C. § 40122(g)(2)(C). The District Court held that, under the provisions of the CSRA, it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioner's claims. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating that because \"5 U.S. C. § 7121(a)(1), as amended in 1994, does not expressly confer federal court jurisdiction over employment-related claims covered by the negotiated grievance procedures of federal employees' collective bargaining agreements,\" his claims are precluded. 382 F.3d 938, 939 (2004). This Court granted certiorari to review the judgment. 545 U.S. 1138 (2005).\nThe Court of Appeals was correct to say that 5 U.S. C. § 7121(a)(1) does not confer jurisdiction. Another statute, howevera very familiar onegrants jurisdiction to the *514 federal courts over \"all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S. C. § 1331. The question, then, is not whether 5 U.S. C. § 7121 confers jurisdiction, but whether § 7121 (or the CSRA as a whole) removes the jurisdiction given to the federal courts, see Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 642 (2002) (holding that \"even if [47 U.S. C.] § 252(e)(6) does not confer jurisdiction, it at least does not divest the district courts of their authority under 28 U.S. C. § 1331 to review the Commission's order for compliance with federal law\"), or otherwise precludes employees from pursuing remedies beyond those set out in the CSRA, cf. United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 443-444 (1988); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967) (\"The question is phrased in terms of `prohibition' rather than `authorization' because ... judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress\").\nIn deciding the question of jurisdiction and preclusion, the Court would be required first to ascertain where Whitman's claims fit within the statutory scheme, as the CSRA provides different treatment for grievances depending on the nature of the claim. It may be, for example, that the FAA's actions, as described by the petitioner, constitute a \"prohibited personnel practice.\" See 5 U.S. C. § 2302(b); 49 U.S. C. § 40122(g)(2)(A). Both the petitioner and the Government say they do not, but because the ultimate question may be jurisdictional, this concession ought not to be accepted out of hand. See Weinberger v. Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 412 U.S. 645, 652 (1973) (\"Parties, of course, cannot confer jurisdiction; only Congress can do so\"). The Court of Appeals did not decide whether the petitioner's allegations state a \"prohibited personnel practice.\" The proper course, then, is to remand for the Court of Appeals to address the matter, see National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 *515 U. S. 459, 470 (1999), as well as the ultimate issue of preclusion. The various other issues raised before this Court, but not decided below, may also be addressed on remand, including: whether the petitioner has challenged final agency action; whether the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies; whether exhaustion is required given this statutory scheme and the Administrative Procedure Act, as interpreted in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137 (1993); and whether the Government has forfeited its exhaustion-of-remedies argument. It may be that a decision on these questions can obviate the need to decide a more difficult question of preclusion.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nJUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nNOTES\n[*]  Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the American Federation of Government Employees et al. by Thomas S.
